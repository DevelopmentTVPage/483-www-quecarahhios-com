                "description": "(1 Oct 2017) Hundreds of Catalans began gathering outside polling stations in the early hours of Sunday as a disputed independence referendum takes place in Catalonia. \r\nIn Vic, a town roughly one hour away from Barcelona, the heart of the independence voters beats as never before. \r\nMany people surrounded a school as Catalan police, known as \"mossos\" approached the organisers to take note of the situation only to leave shortly afterwards, leaving only a wave of applause behind as people chanted \"I will vote.\"\r\nPolls had been expected to open at 9 am local time (0700 GMT).\r\nHowever, due to connection problems with the app especially created by the Catalan Government for the day, people were prevented from voting as soon as the doors were open. \r\nAlmost two hours later people began casting their ballots. \r\nElectoral volunteers at various polling stations said they were unable to access census data because the website that hosted it was down, while the internet service had been cut in some of the stations.\r\nAcross the region, parents, children and activist volunteers had occupied some of the 2,315 schools and other facilities to avoid closure from police acting on court orders.\r\nSpain's Constitutional Court ordered the vote to be suspended and central authorities said it was illegal. \r\nRegional separatist leaders are holding it anyway and promising to declare independence if the \"yes\" side wins.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c54622d58eb6c7f89629e96b6ae465c5 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

I like that.\"  \r\nWestwood added that the collection had to be understood through mythology and fairy tales. \r\n\"It only clicked this morning what is the word for that collection is: \"fairy tale.\" It really is.
