            "description": "(2 Oct 2017) LEADIN:\r\nJordan hopes a ceasefire it helped negotiate in neighbouring southern Syria will eventually advance its long-term goals - securing the border, reopening a vital trade crossing and creating the conditions for a gradual homecoming of Syrian war refugees who sought asylum in the kingdom. \r\nThese targets seem out of reach for now, as key security concerns remain unanswered.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nThese Jordanian troops continue to be stationed at the Syrian border despite a marked decrease in violence in recent months.\r\nFighting has decreased significantly in southern Syria - a patchwork of areas under government or rebel control - since the truce was negotiated by Russia, the US and Jordan in July.\r\nBut Jordan is still waiting for guarantees from Syrian President Bashar Assad and his backers, Russia and Iran, that moderate opposition fighters and civilians will not be harmed as government forces continue to advance under the cover of the truce. \r\nThe pro-Western monarchy also wants to see Iranian-backed forces, including the Lebanese Hezbollah militia, kept away from Jordan's border, and is concerned about a potential resurgence of extremist opposition groups.\r\nJordan has so far received \u201cmixed messages\u201d when raising its concerns, said a senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in exchange for a frank assessment.\r\nMost of the 660,000 registered Syrian refugees in Jordan, many from southern Syria, also seem to be hedging their bets - even if there is a slight uptick in the number of returnees. \r\nThe UN refugee agency said 1,830 refugees returned voluntarily to Syria in July and August, compared to 1,700 in the first six months of the year.\r\nSeparately, Jordan has deported Syrian refugees - about 400 a month since the beginning of 2017, according to a report Monday by the group Human Rights Watch. \r\nA Jordanian government official confirmed previously that some refugees were being deported on security grounds, without providing figures, but denied charges many were being expelled without recourse.\r\nHere, at Nasib border crossing near Daraa, the Free Syrian Army aids those returning to their homeland. \r\n\"We are working to secure this crossing and to facilitate the return of Syrian refugee returnees from Jordan and the return of wounded people coming back from Jordanian hospitals,\" says Abu-Jihad al-Mahmaid, Free Syrian Army manager of returns at Nasib crossing.\r\nHe adds that numbers are increasing because of \"calm conditions\" and calculates that they have registered 302 returnee families in July and 296 returnee families in August.\r\nAbdulrahman al-Ahmad, 32, who spent almost five years in Jordan, returned this month to his opposition-held hometown of Busra al-Sham in the southern Daraa province because he was worn out by life in exile. \r\nIt's a one-way ticket for most returnees, since Jordan generally does not permit re-entry to those who left.\r\n\"I returned to Syria for more than one reason. The first and most important reason is that I missed my family, I missed my friends, I missed my district, I missed my town,\" he explains. \r\n\"The second reason is the ceasefire. Of course one remains afraid for himself, his family, and his son, but the ceasefire was one of the reasons that made me return to Syria, and also the good organisation in my town.\"\r\nWith his house destroyed, al-Ahmad shares another building with displaced people. \r\nResidents have one hour of electricity per day, he says. \r\nThey buy water from private wells at exorbitant prices, and there aren't enough jobs for returnees or medical supplies for the sick, including his three-year-old son who needs a nose operation.\r\n\"I wish our situation would get better. I wish Syria would return to as it was before. We pray to God things will be better than before.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1c28ad3a5ee8fb6cd0566520687d3930 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(2 Oct 2017) LEADIN:\r\nJordan hopes a ceasefire it helped negotiate in neighbouring southern Syria will eventually advance its long-term goals - securing the border, reopening a vital trade crossing and creating the conditions for a gradual homecoming of Syrian war refugees who sought asylum in the kingdom. \r\nThese targets seem out of reach for now, as key security concerns remain unanswered.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nThese Jordanian troops continue to be stationed at the Syrian border despite a marked decrease in violence in recent months.\r\nFighting has decreased significantly in southern Syria - a patchwork of areas under government or rebel control - since the truce was negotiated by Russia, the US and Jordan in July.\r\nBut Jordan is still waiting for guarantees from Syrian President Bashar Assad and his backers, Russia and Iran, that moderate opposition fighters and civilians will not be harmed as government forces continue to advance under the cover of the truce. \r\nThe pro-Western monarchy also wants to see Iranian-backed forces, including the Lebanese Hezbollah militia, kept away from Jordan's border, and is concerned about a potential resurgence of extremist opposition groups.\r\nJordan has so far received \u201cmixed messages\u201d when raising its concerns, said a senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in exchange for a frank assessment.\r\nMost of the 660,000 registered Syrian refugees in Jordan, many from southern Syria, also seem to be hedging their bets - even if there is a slight uptick in the number of returnees. \r\nThe UN refugee agency said 1,830 refugees returned voluntarily to Syria in July and August, compared to 1,700 in the first six months of the year.\r\nSeparately, Jordan has deported Syrian refugees - about 400 a month since the beginning of 2017, according to a report Monday by the group Human Rights Watch. \r\nA Jordanian government official confirmed previously that some refugees were being deported on security grounds, without providing figures, but denied charges many were being expelled without recourse.\r\nHere, at Nasib border crossing near Daraa, the Free Syrian Army aids those returning to their homeland. \r\n\"We are working to secure this crossing and to facilitate the return of Syrian refugee returnees from Jordan and the return of wounded people coming back from Jordanian hospitals,\" says Abu-Jihad al-Mahmaid, Free Syrian Army manager of returns at Nasib crossing.\r\nHe adds that numbers are increasing because of \"calm conditions\" and calculates that they have registered 302 returnee families in July and 296 returnee families in August.\r\nAbdulrahman al-Ahmad, 32, who spent almost five years in Jordan, returned this month to his opposition-held hometown of Busra al-Sham in the southern Daraa province because he was worn out by life in exile. \r\nIt's a one-way ticket for most returnees, since Jordan generally does not permit re-entry to those who left.\r\n\"I returned to Syria for more than one reason. The first and most important reason is that I missed my family, I missed my friends, I missed my district, I missed my town,\" he explains. \r\n\"The second reason is the ceasefire. Of course one remains afraid for himself, his family, and his son, but the ceasefire was one of the reasons that made me return to Syria, and also the good organisation in my town.\"\r\nWith his house destroyed, al-Ahmad shares another building with displaced people. \r\nResidents have one hour of electricity per day, he says. \r\nThey buy water from private wells at exorbitant prices, and there aren't enough jobs for returnees or medical supplies for the sick, including his three-year-old son who needs a nose operation.\r\n\"I wish our situation would get better. I wish Syria would return to as it was before. We pray to God things will be better than before.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1c28ad3a5ee8fb6cd0566520687d3930 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

And as a millennial, as a former mayor and a state legislator, I cannot afford a single-family home in a community that I work and represent,\" said Evan Low, a Calfornia state assemblyman representing Silicon Valley. \r\nBrown signed 15 bills outside a San Francisco affordable housing complex. \r\nThe bills include more money to build affordable housing and policies to speed up construction stalled by regulations.\r\nBut it will be several years before affordable housing units start popping up across the state and, when they do, they won't cover California's full demand.\r\nA 4 billion US dollar housing bond still needs approval from voters at the ballot box in 2018.\r\nThe 75 US dollar fee on real estate transaction documents created in another bill is expected to generate between 200 and 300 million US dollars a year - far less than the 1 billion US dollars handed out to communities through redevelopment funds Brown halted in 2012.\r\nThe money combined in the bills is expected to create up to 90,000 affordable rental homes in the next seven to 10 years, a fraction of what's needed.\r\nBeyond the money, other bills aim to streamline regulations that can slow down construction for a variety of reasons, including communities needlessly delaying projects they don't want.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/88d35730fbc8bade6e6a84776d7774e0 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

And as a millennial, as a former mayor and a state legislator, I cannot afford a single-family home in a community that I work and represent,\" said Evan Low, a Calfornia state assemblyman representing Silicon Valley. \r\nBrown signed 15 bills outside a San Francisco affordable housing complex. \r\nThe bills include more money to build affordable housing and policies to speed up construction stalled by regulations.\r\nBut it will be several years before affordable housing units start popping up across the state and, when they do, they won't cover California's full demand.\r\nA 4 billion US dollar housing bond still needs approval from voters at the ballot box in 2018.\r\nThe 75 US dollar fee on real estate transaction documents created in another bill is expected to generate between 200 and 300 million US dollars a year - far less than the 1 billion US dollars handed out to communities through redevelopment funds Brown halted in 2012.\r\nThe money combined in the bills is expected to create up to 90,000 affordable rental homes in the next seven to 10 years, a fraction of what's needed.\r\nBeyond the money, other bills aim to streamline regulations that can slow down construction for a variety of reasons, including communities needlessly delaying projects they don't want.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/88d35730fbc8bade6e6a84776d7774e0 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

The first and most important reason is that I missed my family, I missed my friends, I missed my district, I missed my town,\" he explains. \r\n\"The second reason is the ceasefire. Of course one remains afraid for himself, his family, and his son, but the ceasefire was one of the reasons that made me return to Syria, and also the good organisation in my town.\"\r\nWith his house destroyed, al-Ahmad shares another building with displaced people. \r\nResidents have one hour of electricity per day, he says. \r\nThey buy water from private wells at exorbitant prices, and there aren't enough jobs for returnees or medical supplies for the sick, including his three-year-old son who needs a nose operation.\r\n\"I wish our situation would get better. I wish Syria would return to as it was before.
