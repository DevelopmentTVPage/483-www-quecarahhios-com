American photojournalist Wesley Bocxe and his wife Elizabeth made it to the roof of his ten-story apartment building when the quake started; his wife was killed when the floors underneath pancaked underneath them, but Bocxe somehow survived the plunge, though he was seriously injured.\r\nLocal media quoted one woman who said that she and two relatives took refuge in the bathroom of their upper floor apartment, and the room _ apparently constructed more sturdily than the rest of the building _ plunged intact to near street level, and they were able to escape with the help of neighbors.\r\nFor a family of four from the Iztapalapa neighborhood on the city's gritty east side, the quake was so nightmarish that the family's father briefly lost it.\r\nThe family asked not to be identified by name for privacy reasons.\r\nThey rushed out of their home with their nine-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son when the quake started, only to have a six-foot (two meter) perimeter wall fall on the children. The girl's pelvis was crushed, her liver damaged and she had internal bleeding. The son had an exposed fracture of his leg, with the bone poking though and blood spurting out.\r\nThe mother helped her son, who was crawling, to get to the street, and she walked into traffic to stop a car.\r\nOnce they got to the hospital, policemen station outside saw the girl's condition and quickly offered to summon a helicopter, which ferried both children to the Magdalena de la Salinas hospital.\r\nThe girl is wrapped in sheets on her hospital bed, her father holding her hand.

            "description": "(28 Sep 2017) ICON AUDREY HEPBURN'S CLOTHES AND PERSONAL EFFECTS AUCTIONED AT CHRISTIE'S \r\nBidders from around the world had Audrey Hepburn in their sights on Wednesday (27SEPT2017) as the Hollywood actress' collection of clothes and personal effects were auctioned at Christie's in London. \r\nHepburn, who died in 1993, was a film icon whose best-known movies included \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\" \"Charade\" and \"My Fair Lady.\" \r\nBut she was also a towering figure in the fashion world, credited with popularising the concept of the \"little black dress\".\r\nSome of the items on sale went for more than ten times their estimated price. \r\nHepburn's little black dress from \"Charade\" went for 92,000 US dollars, including the buyer's premium, compared with a pre-sale estimate of 64,000-100,000 US dollars.\r\nHer working script for \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" went for 847,000 US dollars, including the buyer's premium, compared with a pre-sale estimate of 70,000-110,000 US dollars.\r\nAnd her Burberry trench coat, regarded as one of her signature fashion statements, was sold for 92,000 US dollars, almost ten times its pre-sale estimate.\r\nEven a humble sleep mask worn by Hepburn, which had been expected to sell for less than 200 US dollars, made more than 8,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9aa487c516ded26de7c02b7d0c63c109 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
