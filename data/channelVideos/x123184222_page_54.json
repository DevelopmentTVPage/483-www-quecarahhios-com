                "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Italian police said on Wednesday that they had arrested 37 people, including two Carabinieri officers, accused in a Sicilian Mafia extortion racket involving fruits, fish and drugs.\r\nThey also said they had seized 11 million euros (13 million) in assets. \r\nPolice said one victim was the owner of an upmarket Via Veneto restaurant in Rome who was forced to come up with 180,000 euros (212,000 dollars) after receiving threats from mobsters over fruit and vegetable deliveries.\r\nTwo Carabinieri officers are accused of illegally using information from a police database to extort the owner.\r\nThe investigation focused on the Rinzivillo family of Gela, Sicily, and its drug-dealing envoys in Germany. \r\nIt showed how Cosa Nostra had infiltrated Rome businesses, using legitimate fresh and frozen fish front companies, and made alliances with other organised crime groups, including the 'ndrangheta and Camorra.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3115fc28b5af0ca00d64f4739b270d2b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

The agreement states a search warrant found more than 50,000 images of child porn on Salling's computer and a thumb drive.\r\nProsecutors and Salling have agreed to ask a judge to sentence the actor to a prison term between four to seven years. He will also be required to register as a sex offender, pay restitution and abide by restrictions on where he can live.\r\nSalling's attorney Michael Proctor did not immediately return a message seeking comment.\r\nThe actor played bad-boy Noah ``Puck'' Puckerman on the Fox musical dramedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/227cd7fdfe4bbd3615d6dc6a4735e71e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

I came a few times to see this room.\" \r\nVisitors can also take a close look at a full size recreation of Sadat's home office.\r\nWith all of the different displays to take in, student and museum visitor Mohamed Reda has come to the exhibition three times already.\r\n\"I like to come see the uniform in which he was martyred, and his belongings, and everything, because I love President Sadat very much and because of that I come often to look at his things.\" \r\nMuseum manager Amre Shalabi explains that the exhibition had actually started as an attempt to bring all the artefacts together to put online.\r\n\"Before we founded the museum, we fought a battle to preserve and keep the archives which document his life in photographs, documents, and video, and audio, and to provide them all on the internet free of charge at Sadat.bibalex.org. That was the beginning, then, we moved to the second stage where we said, why can't there be a museum for President Sadat?\"\r\nThey were able to come to an agreement with Sadat's widow, First Lady Jehan Sadat, who allowed many personal objects to be displayed.\r\nShalabi says that it is the diversity of displays which keeps people interested.\r\n\"I think the museum shows a collection which helps people re-examine the history of Anwar Sadat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c9b85b80d800e57111d4154022b2d292 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
