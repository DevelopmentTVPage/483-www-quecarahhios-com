So the equipment was no longer needed in manufacturing, it was passed to this shop, and everyone who wanted it, bought it. I bought such things there.\"\r\nWhen Basargin found out about the opening of the museum, he decided to make dozens of his collectibles a part of computer history, picking them up off the dusty shelves and donating them to Skynet.\r\nYear by year it becomes more difficult to find old Soviet computers - most people have thrown out old hardware.\r\n\"We have several dozens of Soviet computers here,\" says Martyanov. \r\n\"Actually, there were a lot of various computers produced in the Soviet Union, and the engineering industry kept pace with the times, striving to replicate and improve exhibits, so to improve those developments from abroad.\"\r\nWhile computers today can fit in the palm of our hands, those of the past were a much larger operation.\r\nMartyanov switches on an old computer and the whirring of the fan starts up.\r\n\"There were five of those fans in a single cupboard.

            "description": "(29 Sep 2017) LEAD IN:\r\nTattooists are busy with their buzzing ink guns at Hong Kong's International Tattoo Convention. \r\nThe event - now in its fifth year - is drawing almost 300 tattoo artists from around the world, including several female artists keen to showcase their skills.\r\n\r\nSTORY-LINE:\r\nLocal and international tattoo artists are gathering in Hong Kong for what's claimed to be Asia's largest tattoo convention. \r\nEnthusiasts are lining up to get inked by well-known tattooists from Japan, Singapore, China and Taiwan. \r\nOrganiser Gabe Shum, who's a big name on Hong Kong's tattoo scene, says he hopes the event will help shed the stigma long associated with tattoos.\r\n\"I hope that there will be more participants (in this event), more members of the public will come and know more about our tattoos,\" he says.\r\n\"We are not asking everyone to get tattoos. Due to social advancement, more things should be accepted. \r\n\"Today, I can say that according to international statistics, on average one out of every three people has a tattoo. \r\n\"For example, in the previous Olympic Games, there were many young athletes\u2026 basically for every ten people, three or four had tattoos. \r\n\"Some of them had tattoos behind their ears. In fact, tattoos are now a part of pop culture. \r\n\"Tattoos represent us (represent who we are). Many parents are afraid that their children have tattoos. \r\n\"Instead of worrying, they should come and see, whether tattoos are as bad as they thought in the past.\"\r\nShum, who's known for his delicate freehand work, once tattooed former Manchester United footballer David Beckham.\r\nA ball signed by the English superstar is set to be auctioned off during the convention to raise money for a local cancer charity.\r\nBorn without a left forearm, Hong Kong-based tattoo artist Alley Leong says her disability hasn't negatively impacted her career.  \r\n\"In fact, there is no big difficulty (as a tattoo artist),\" she says.\r\n\"But sometimes after working for a long time, my waist hurts. It's no big deal. I can overcome (this problem).\"\r\nLeong says she was shy as a child. She found art and design a great way to express herself.\r\n\"Since I was a kid, I did not enjoy talking to others,\" she says.\r\n\"Maybe that's the reason why I use drawings to express myself.\"\r\nPolish tattoo artist, Aga Yadou, is visiting Hong Kong's tattoo convention for the first time. It was recommended by a Warsaw-based colleague.\r\n\"Yeah, it's my first time here,\" she says.\r\n\"My friend from the shop who is working with me in Warsaw, was here last time. \r\n\"And he said, it's great. So I ask him, if he wouldn't mind if I can come. So he arranged everything for us and I love it already.\"\r\nYadou's tattoos are watercolour inspired and often feature intricate floral designs and animals such as horses and foxes.\r\n\"The only thing I could expect, it's going to be different than European conventions,\" she says.\r\n\"And it's already very well organised. It's spacious and there is a lot of cool artists around.\"\r\nHong Kong's International Tattoo Convention runs 29 September to 1 October at the Kai Tak cruise terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9cfd86097e391bf0d465e3e489813d3e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(29 Sep 2017) LEAD IN:\r\nTattooists are busy with their buzzing ink guns at Hong Kong's International Tattoo Convention. \r\nThe event - now in its fifth year - is drawing almost 300 tattoo artists from around the world, including several female artists keen to showcase their skills.\r\n\r\nSTORY-LINE:\r\nLocal and international tattoo artists are gathering in Hong Kong for what's claimed to be Asia's largest tattoo convention. \r\nEnthusiasts are lining up to get inked by well-known tattooists from Japan, Singapore, China and Taiwan. \r\nOrganiser Gabe Shum, who's a big name on Hong Kong's tattoo scene, says he hopes the event will help shed the stigma long associated with tattoos.\r\n\"I hope that there will be more participants (in this event), more members of the public will come and know more about our tattoos,\" he says.\r\n\"We are not asking everyone to get tattoos. Due to social advancement, more things should be accepted. \r\n\"Today, I can say that according to international statistics, on average one out of every three people has a tattoo. \r\n\"For example, in the previous Olympic Games, there were many young athletes\u2026 basically for every ten people, three or four had tattoos. \r\n\"Some of them had tattoos behind their ears. In fact, tattoos are now a part of pop culture. \r\n\"Tattoos represent us (represent who we are). Many parents are afraid that their children have tattoos. \r\n\"Instead of worrying, they should come and see, whether tattoos are as bad as they thought in the past.\"\r\nShum, who's known for his delicate freehand work, once tattooed former Manchester United footballer David Beckham.\r\nA ball signed by the English superstar is set to be auctioned off during the convention to raise money for a local cancer charity.\r\nBorn without a left forearm, Hong Kong-based tattoo artist Alley Leong says her disability hasn't negatively impacted her career.  \r\n\"In fact, there is no big difficulty (as a tattoo artist),\" she says.\r\n\"But sometimes after working for a long time, my waist hurts. It's no big deal. I can overcome (this problem).\"\r\nLeong says she was shy as a child. She found art and design a great way to express herself.\r\n\"Since I was a kid, I did not enjoy talking to others,\" she says.\r\n\"Maybe that's the reason why I use drawings to express myself.\"\r\nPolish tattoo artist, Aga Yadou, is visiting Hong Kong's tattoo convention for the first time. It was recommended by a Warsaw-based colleague.\r\n\"Yeah, it's my first time here,\" she says.\r\n\"My friend from the shop who is working with me in Warsaw, was here last time. \r\n\"And he said, it's great. So I ask him, if he wouldn't mind if I can come. So he arranged everything for us and I love it already.\"\r\nYadou's tattoos are watercolour inspired and often feature intricate floral designs and animals such as horses and foxes.\r\n\"The only thing I could expect, it's going to be different than European conventions,\" she says.\r\n\"And it's already very well organised. It's spacious and there is a lot of cool artists around.\"\r\nHong Kong's International Tattoo Convention runs 29 September to 1 October at the Kai Tak cruise terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9cfd86097e391bf0d465e3e489813d3e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Gay couples living in Germany prepared to welcome a long-awaited law legalizing same-sex marriage, which comes into effect on Sunday.\r\nThe law brings Germany in line with many of its Western peers.\r\nBodo Mende and Karl Kreile, both born in 1957, and living and working as civil servants in Berlin, met on 14 July in 1979.  \r\nNow they are counting the days to finally get married on Sunday morning.\r\n\"We no longer have a second-class partnership, but finally have a partnership equal to all the other heterosexual partnerships, which are working just as good or just as bad as homosexual partnerships,\" said Bodo Mende.\r\nGermany has allowed same-sex couples to enter civil partnerships since 2001, but had not granted them full marital rights, which include the possibility to jointly adopt children. \r\nChancellor Angela Merkel voted against the measure, but paved the way for its passage by allowing members of her conservative party to vote according to their conscience.\r\nLawmakers voted 393-226 to legalize \"marriage for everybody,\" with four abstentions.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/2f95ff6b6d6da33862a86509f69de549 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

So the equipment was no longer needed in manufacturing, it was passed to this shop, and everyone who wanted it, bought it. I bought such things there.\"\r\nWhen Basargin found out about the opening of the museum, he decided to make dozens of his collectibles a part of computer history, picking them up off the dusty shelves and donating them to Skynet.\r\nYear by year it becomes more difficult to find old Soviet computers - most people have thrown out old hardware.\r\n\"We have several dozens of Soviet computers here,\" says Martyanov. \r\n\"Actually, there were a lot of various computers produced in the Soviet Union, and the engineering industry kept pace with the times, striving to replicate and improve exhibits, so to improve those developments from abroad.\"\r\nWhile computers today can fit in the palm of our hands, those of the past were a much larger operation.\r\nMartyanov switches on an old computer and the whirring of the fan starts up.\r\n\"There were five of those fans in a single cupboard. And there could be a few dozens of the cupboards in a big room. All of this was a single computer,\" he says, marvelling at the thought.\r\n\"The place where the computer was located was called a machine hall. You can imagine what noise was made by one cupboard and what noise was in a room where the computer was installed.\"\r\nToday, these old devices make today's users laugh: calculators were bigger than modern tablets and units looked more like chandeliers stuffed with lamps.\r\nEvery month up to 4000 people come to Skynet, most of them are students of local schools and colleges. \r\nThe most popular part of the exhibition is the gaming zone.\r\nThese youngsters are trying out video games.\r\nThey can't understand how people used the devices in the past.\r\nBut the gaming zone also features more up-to-date technology.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/80f5fba3862e4b1c22da3dcfddb57bed \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
