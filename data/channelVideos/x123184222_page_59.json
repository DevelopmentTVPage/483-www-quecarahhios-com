Blige, Carey Mulligan and Garrett Hedlund were in London's Leicester Square on Thursday night (5 OCT. 2017) for the premiere of \"Mudbound.\"\r\nDirected by Dee Rees, \"Mudbound\" is based on Hillary Jordan's 2008 novel of the same name.\r\nIt chronicles the lives of two families in the WWII-era South \u2014 one white and one black, and the complicated intersectionality of their paths. \r\nThere's the McAllans, Laura (Carey Mulligan), her husband Henry (Jason Clarke), his brother Jamie (Garrett Hedlund) and their father Pappy (Jonathan Banks), and the Jacksons, Florence (Mary J. Blige), her husband Hap (Rob Morgan) and their son Ronsel (Jason Mitchell).\r\nThey're tied together by a rental agreement \u2014 the Jackson's rent their land and home from the McAllans \u2014 and the deeply complicated racial relationships in the segregated South in which Henry can demand help from Hap at any moment and Pappy can insist that Ronsel exit the local store from the back entrance.\r\nIt's a sprawling and deeply American story about women, men, race and personhood that defies a simple summary.\r\nRees, who directed \"Pariah\" and the HBO movie \"Bessie,\" said it's a film that shows that \"all our narratives are intertwined.\"\r\nSpeaking at the premiere, Rees said she didn't set out \"with a message to educate people.\"\r\n\"But I am inviting people to consider their lives and to consider themselves and to consider their families because I think it starts with our own personal histories and so if you can interrogate your own personal history, then there's no way you can interrogate our collective history and I think this film demonstrates that.\"\r\n\"That's the beautiful thing about the movie,\" said Jason Mitchell. \"it's not bias, it's not trying to demonize white people or victimize black people or do any of that. You don't leave the cinema feeling I'm angry right now. It ends with love. It's a beautiful thing. And you get to see everybody's struggle and everybody's needs and their wants you know.\"\r\nMary J. Blige said she hoped the film would get its audience \"to think from other people's point of view.\"\r\n\"It will have us looking at each other and looking at ourselves like 'You know, we have a lot of work to do and we need each other to get it done. We need each other more than we know.'\"\r\nShe also described how she gave the role everything she had.\r\n\"Mary J. Blige is not in this film,\" she said. \"Florence Jackson is in this film.

            "description": "(5 Oct 2017) LEADIN:\r\nOne of London's best-known parks is playing host to a wide variety of sculptures by the likes of Eduardo Paolozzi and the cult American artist known as KAWS. \r\nThere's also a strong statement on racial inclusion from British artist Thomas J. Price. \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nFar from Frieze art fair's frantic booths and packed hallways, towering artworks are invading London's autumnal Regents Park.\r\nThe art fair's annual Frieze Sculpture, claimed to be London's largest outdoor exhibition, is showcasing 24 artists.\r\nOne highlight is this towering metallic giant by late Scottish sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. Made in 1999, it was one of Paolozzi's last monumental commissions.\r\nThe sculpture park was curated by Claire Lilley, the director of Yorkshire Sculpture Park. She says it's very different to curating a traditional exhibit.\r\n\"I'm looking for really high-quality sculpture, I'm looking for sculpture that is of interest to major international collectors, but I'm also looking to make an exhibition that is very accessible to a very, very diverse public,\" she says. \r\n\"Because this is a very public park, it's an incredibly busy park, you have people coming here for lunch, you have people coming here with their babies, exercising, people have parties here.\"\r\nAnd since they're not nailed to gallery walls, the artworks can be explored, viewed and interacted with in new and exciting ways.\r\nVisitors can gaze skywards at this upturned elephant by Spanish artist Miquel Barcelo or perhaps become hynotised by this swinging hammock by US artist Sarah Sze.\r\n\"So, the wonderful thing about sculptures is even though they're static, we enable them to move and it's an immersive all encompassing, all sensory experience,\" says art critic Estelle Lovatt.\r\n\"Because we move around the sculpture and as we move around it looks different from every angle.\"\r\nOne highlight is this towering seven-metre tall sculpture by US artist KAWS. \r\nNamed 'FINAL DAYS', it exhibits the artist's unique toy-like style, while at the same time appearing monstrous and domineering.\r\nKAWS is a popular choice for social media fans. He boasts almost 900,000 followers on picture-sharing app Instagram. Over 500,000 more than Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei, for instance.\r\n\"He started work as a street artist, he works with designers, he makes clothing ranges, he has this incredible reach, an enormous, enormously diverse audience and he kind of has a cult following,\" says Lilley.\r\n\"That isn't necessarily important, but what it means is the work is extremely accessible to a very wide public and that's really, really important for people coming into the space, that they have something that can catch hold of, that they can understand, that there's an immediacy.\"\r\nBritish artist Thomas J. Price is showcasing this recent three-part work, named 'Numen (Shifting Votive One, Two and Three)'.\r\nCast in grey aluminium and set on marble plinths, they're intended to resemble commemorative busts.\r\n\"He's dealing with issues which I think are very important within our society, specifically here, the non-representation of black people in the public realm as sculptures, as statues,\" says Lilley.\r\n\"But he's brought his very contemporary bearing to these works, he's cast them in aluminium, which just physically because of the colour of the aluminium, makes them very startling.\"\r\nJapanese artist Takuro Kuwata is showcasing these towering 'tree' sculptures' formed from porcelain, stone, glaze, pigment, steel, gold and laquer.\r\nKuwata often transforms traditional Japanese pottery techniques to create bright, ambitious ceramic works.\r\n\"I think the wonderful thing about having sculptures outside in the park is that it engages with people that are perhaps too afraid to go into a gallery space,\" says Lovatt.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/04470bafa821357c3db7bf7d331c58c7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

The 8-cylinder, 150 horse powered car has a top speed of 205 kilometres per hour and the German car maker only produced 251 of them.\r\nA \"normal\" 507 Roadster will cost between 1.5 and 2.5 million euros, depending on the condition.\r\nBut this one is far from normal - it was once owned by Elvis Presley when he was stationed in Berlin as a US soldier.\r\nLegend has it that he had the car painted red because he got tired of women marking the vehicle with lipstick. A hint on the original red colour has intentionally been left in a small corner behind the driver's door.\r\n\"This is a car with three stories,\" explains Stefan Behr, spokesman for \"BMW classics\", part of the BMW brand that deals with classic cars.\r\n\"To start off, it was a show car at the IAA motor show (in Frankfurt in 1955). Secondly, Hans-Joachim Stueck (Formula One driver) drove this car. And finally, it was also owned by Elvis Presley.\"\r\nElvis Presley was stationed in Germany in 1958-1960 and to get around he bought the BMW 507 roadster.\r\nIn 2006 the car was found in a barn in California by Jackie Jouret, a journalist at Bimmer, a magazine focusing on BMW news.\r\nTracking the serial numbers she confirmed that the car was the same that Elvis drove around in Germany, and also the same as the one Formula One legend Hans-Joachim Stueck had driven.\r\nThe car was eventually sent to Munich in Germany where it was restored by Klaus Kutscher \u2013 an expert in vintage car restoration at BMW Group Classic\r\n\"It is priceless,\" says Behr.\r\n\"The Elvis 507 is not on the market. To know a price you would need to compare it to other products. But this one is not on the market, it is not going to get sold so therefore it is impossible to guess a price.\"\r\nAnother car with a thick sprinkle of stardust is this Ford Mustang Eleanor, made in 1967.\r\nIt is in itself a classic car, loved by collectors worldwide.\r\nBut this is the original car used in the movie \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" with Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie.\r\nIt was one of three Ford Mustang Eleanor vehicles on the set, and it has just been bought by Chrome Cars, based in Jena in Germany.\r\nThe company is planning on using it as a show car for the foreseeable future, but it says if the right buyer with the right offer comes along it would probably sell.\r\nThe company doesn't want to give a price, but Christian Zoellner, the sales manager for Chrome Cars, says that a copy of the same car recently sold for 1.5 million US dollars.\r\n\"Who would buy a car like this? It could be Mustang fans. It could be a collector that buys it as an investment. Or simply just a car enthusiast and fan. I think here you kill like seven birds with one stone. This car is probably not just for Mustang fans,\" he says.\r\nOne car with a similar price-tag is this Mercedes-Benz 300 SL coupe from 1954.\r\nThe sleek sports car is a classic and loved by collectors and enthusiasts.\r\nThis one, in a pristine condition, will set you back 1.5 million euros.\r\nAfter years of growth, the classic car market is still growing, according to Marc Baumueller, CEO of Motorworld.\r\n\"It is like the art market,\" he says.\r\n\"The vehicles are not made anymore so, therefore, the prices are increasing. But it will not always be like that. Just like in an art market the prices can both go up and down. But when you look at the development of the German market then you see that it has become an international market.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/11757570fc216c46cef2d908688e9f71 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Weinstein greeted her wearing a bathrobe and asked her if she would give him a massage or watch him shower, the paper reported.\r\n\"Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it's simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly,\" Judd told the Times.\r\nTwo company officials tell the Times that at least eight women have received settlements from Weinstein over the years, including actress Rose McGowan, who allegedly had an incident with him in 1997 when she was 23.\r\nWeinstein's attorney Charles J. Harder said in a statement that the story is \"saturated with false and defamatory statements about Harvey Weinstein.\"\r\n\"We sent the Times the facts and evidence, but they ignored it and rushed to publish,\" Harder said. He did not respond to questions about what specific allegations Weinstein was contesting.\r\nRequests for comment from The Weinstein Co. and Judd were not immediately returned.\r\nWeinstein had a powerful perch in Hollywood for three decades, and was known for producing films like \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Shakespeare in Love,\" for which he won an Oscar, and launching careers of actresses and directors with his company \r\nMiramax, which he ran with his brother Bob Weinstein. In 2005, they launched a new production company, The Weinstein Company. His often aggressive tactics were chronicled in the Peter Biskind book \"Down and Dirty Pictures.\"\r\n\"I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it,\" Weinstein said in a statement. \"Though I'm trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.\"\r\nHis statement did not address any specific incidents.\r\nWeinstein has been married to designer Georgina Chapman since 2007, they have two children together.

He also said the bakery has a \"cleaning contract of $100,000 per year,\" along with a pest control contract.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/efdf1ce744ed51b93987788b60e04a38 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(5 Oct 2017) MARY J. BLIGE, CAREY MULLIGAN AND GARRETT HEDLUND BRING 'MUDBOUND' TO LONDON \r\nMary J. Blige, Carey Mulligan and Garrett Hedlund were in London's Leicester Square on Thursday night (5 OCT. 2017) for the premiere of \"Mudbound.\"\r\nDirected by Dee Rees, \"Mudbound\" is based on Hillary Jordan's 2008 novel of the same name.\r\nIt chronicles the lives of two families in the WWII-era South \u2014 one white and one black, and the complicated intersectionality of their paths. \r\nThere's the McAllans, Laura (Carey Mulligan), her husband Henry (Jason Clarke), his brother Jamie (Garrett Hedlund) and their father Pappy (Jonathan Banks), and the Jacksons, Florence (Mary J. Blige), her husband Hap (Rob Morgan) and their son Ronsel (Jason Mitchell).\r\nThey're tied together by a rental agreement \u2014 the Jackson's rent their land and home from the McAllans \u2014 and the deeply complicated racial relationships in the segregated South in which Henry can demand help from Hap at any moment and Pappy can insist that Ronsel exit the local store from the back entrance.\r\nIt's a sprawling and deeply American story about women, men, race and personhood that defies a simple summary.\r\nRees, who directed \"Pariah\" and the HBO movie \"Bessie,\" said it's a film that shows that \"all our narratives are intertwined.\"\r\nSpeaking at the premiere, Rees said she didn't set out \"with a message to educate people.\"\r\n\"But I am inviting people to consider their lives and to consider themselves and to consider their families because I think it starts with our own personal histories and so if you can interrogate your own personal history, then there's no way you can interrogate our collective history and I think this film demonstrates that.\"\r\n\"That's the beautiful thing about the movie,\" said Jason Mitchell. \"it's not bias, it's not trying to demonize white people or victimize black people or do any of that. You don't leave the cinema feeling I'm angry right now. It ends with love. It's a beautiful thing. And you get to see everybody's struggle and everybody's needs and their wants you know.\"\r\nMary J. Blige said she hoped the film would get its audience \"to think from other people's point of view.\"\r\n\"It will have us looking at each other and looking at ourselves like 'You know, we have a lot of work to do and we need each other to get it done. We need each other more than we know.'\"\r\nShe also described how she gave the role everything she had.\r\n\"Mary J. Blige is not in this film,\" she said. \"Florence Jackson is in this film. Mary J. Blige is playing a character by the name of Florence Jackson and I commit all and I give all to Florence. I let got of every piece of vain thing that I could think of so that this powerful, even more stronger than Mary J. Blige can live.\"\r\n\"Mudbound\" is showing as part of the London Film Festival.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/aa9a125309b6f91a43040e20b106a576 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Price. \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nFar from Frieze art fair's frantic booths and packed hallways, towering artworks are invading London's autumnal Regents Park.\r\nThe art fair's annual Frieze Sculpture, claimed to be London's largest outdoor exhibition, is showcasing 24 artists.\r\nOne highlight is this towering metallic giant by late Scottish sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. Made in 1999, it was one of Paolozzi's last monumental commissions.\r\nThe sculpture park was curated by Claire Lilley, the director of Yorkshire Sculpture Park. She says it's very different to curating a traditional exhibit.\r\n\"I'm looking for really high-quality sculpture, I'm looking for sculpture that is of interest to major international collectors, but I'm also looking to make an exhibition that is very accessible to a very, very diverse public,\" she says. \r\n\"Because this is a very public park, it's an incredibly busy park, you have people coming here for lunch, you have people coming here with their babies, exercising, people have parties here.\"\r\nAnd since they're not nailed to gallery walls, the artworks can be explored, viewed and interacted with in new and exciting ways.\r\nVisitors can gaze skywards at this upturned elephant by Spanish artist Miquel Barcelo or perhaps become hynotised by this swinging hammock by US artist Sarah Sze.\r\n\"So, the wonderful thing about sculptures is even though they're static, we enable them to move and it's an immersive all encompassing, all sensory experience,\" says art critic Estelle Lovatt.\r\n\"Because we move around the sculpture and as we move around it looks different from every angle.\"\r\nOne highlight is this towering seven-metre tall sculpture by US artist KAWS. \r\nNamed 'FINAL DAYS', it exhibits the artist's unique toy-like style, while at the same time appearing monstrous and domineering.\r\nKAWS is a popular choice for social media fans. He boasts almost 900,000 followers on picture-sharing app Instagram. Over 500,000 more than Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei, for instance.\r\n\"He started work as a street artist, he works with designers, he makes clothing ranges, he has this incredible reach, an enormous, enormously diverse audience and he kind of has a cult following,\" says Lilley.\r\n\"That isn't necessarily important, but what it means is the work is extremely accessible to a very wide public and that's really, really important for people coming into the space, that they have something that can catch hold of, that they can understand, that there's an immediacy.\"\r\nBritish artist Thomas J. Price is showcasing this recent three-part work, named 'Numen (Shifting Votive One, Two and Three)'.\r\nCast in grey aluminium and set on marble plinths, they're intended to resemble commemorative busts.\r\n\"He's dealing with issues which I think are very important within our society, specifically here, the non-representation of black people in the public realm as sculptures, as statues,\" says Lilley.\r\n\"But he's brought his very contemporary bearing to these works, he's cast them in aluminium, which just physically because of the colour of the aluminium, makes them very startling.\"\r\nJapanese artist Takuro Kuwata is showcasing these towering 'tree' sculptures' formed from porcelain, stone, glaze, pigment, steel, gold and laquer.\r\nKuwata often transforms traditional Japanese pottery techniques to create bright, ambitious ceramic works.\r\n\"I think the wonderful thing about having sculptures outside in the park is that it engages with people that are perhaps too afraid to go into a gallery space,\" says Lovatt.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/04470bafa821357c3db7bf7d331c58c7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(5 Oct 2017) A suicide bomber struck a Shiite shrine packed with worshippers in a remote village in southwestern Pakistan on Thursday, killing 20 people and leaving at least 25 wounded, a provincial government spokesman and the police said.\r\nWithin hours, the Islamic State group (IS) claimed responsibility for the attack.\r\nThe bomber detonated his explosives vest when he was stopped for a routine search by a police officer guarding the shrine in the village of Jhal Masgi, about 400 kilometres (240 miles) east of Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province.\r\nAnwarul Haq Kakar, spokesman for the provincial government, said the death toll could rise further as some of the wounded remained in critical condition.\r\nMohammad Iqbal, a district police chief, said five children, a woman and one police officer were among those 20 people killed in the bombing.\r\nHe said they found body parts of the attacker and investigators were trying to determine who was behind the bombing.\r\nSarfraz Bugti, the provincial home minister, said \"terrorists have shown their inhumanity by attacking innocent civilians\" at the shrine.\r\nAtif Ali Shah, the custodian of the shrine, told reporters that had the attacker managed to enter the shrine, there would have been many more casualties. \r\nThe police officer who stopped the bomber and other guards who rushed to the scene \"saved many lives,\" he said.\r\nHundreds of devotees were present at the shrine for a monthly gathering when the bomber hit. \r\nLocal TV footage showed people crying for help in the immediate aftermath of the attack.\r\nJust hours earlier, Pakistani army spokesman Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor said the military had received credible reports of upcoming terror attacks. \r\nGhafoor told a news conference in the garrison city of Rawalpindi that the government has been alerted about possible attacks.\r\nThe claim by the IS affiliate in Pakistan came later on Thursday, in a statement posted on the Islamic State-linked Aamaq news agency.\r\nIS and other Sunni extremists perceive Shiites as apostates who should be killed and have carried out many such attacks in the past, targeting minority Shiite Muslims in Baluchistan and elsewhere in the country.\r\nPakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi condemned the attack, saying that \"terrorists have no religion\" and that his government will act against militants with full might.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/05ebeb443087e944a9d755f39074ad9b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
