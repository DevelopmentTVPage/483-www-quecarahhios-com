            "description": "(5 Oct 2017) LEADIN: \r\nA new report shows that 75 percent of honey samples tested from around the globe contain a key pesticide, linked to the decline in the number of bees.\r\nIt comes as Europe decides whether to enforce an outright ban on neuro toxic pesticides. \r\nSTORYLINE: \r\nAlways busy, bees are responsible for pollinating a third of all the food we eat.\r\nOur fruit and vegetables would not grow without them.\r\nBut a global study published by scientists at the University of Neuch\u00e2tel today (5 October 2017) shows we are contaminating bees, if not killing them.\r\nThe culprits are seven chemicals used in pesticides called neonicotinoids.\r\nAlthough there is no evidence to suggest they are harming humans, today's report published in the journal Science says the chemicals are now in bees and so probably in other pollinating insect populations worldwide.\r\nThe European Food Standards Agency is along with the EU parliament deciding what action to take.\r\nRichard Glassborow is the chairman of the London Beekeepers' Association.\r\nHe says: \"Well bees are insects, and pesticides are designed to take out pest insects, but they're pretty indiscriminate.\"\r\nThe EU introduced a partial ban on neonicotinoids in 2013, which outlawed their use on flowering crops such as sunflowers and oil seed rape, but they can still be used on other crops.  \r\nBees and other pollinators have been on the decline for more than a decade and experts blame a combination of factors: neonics, parasites, disease, climate change and lack of a diverse food supply. \r\nBees pick up the pesticide when they feed on fields grown from treated seeds.\r\nAs part of a citizen science project, the Swiss researchers asked other experts, friends and relatives to ship them honey samples. More than 300 samples arrived and researchers tested 198 of them for five of the most common types of neonics.\r\nOverall, 75 percent of the samples had at least one neonic, 45 percent had two or more and 10 percent had four or more.\r\nProfessor David Goulson, from the University of Sussex, is a peer commentator on the results of today's study: \"A worldwide survey of neonicotinoids in honey\".\r\nHe says: \"The majority of the samples contain concentrations which are high enough to have an effect on the bees, probably not to kill them, at least not quickly, so below the lethal dose, but enough to do them other forms of harm, so called sub-lethal effects. So we know for example these chemicals, they attack the brain of the insect and they interfere with their ability to learn and to navigate, which is really important for a bee. A honey bee and other kinds of bee they have to be able to find their way to and from patches of flowers and back to their hive and if they get lost then they're as good as dead.\"\r\nIt's not just the brains of the bees that are being messed up according to Goulson.\r\nHe says: \"Also we know these chemicals at low concentrations mess up the immune system of the honey bee so then they get infected with diseases, so the long and the short of it is that we should be worried about this, that it seems that a large proportion of the world's honey bees and probably other bees too are being continually exposed to toxins at a level that will be doing them harm.\"\r\nOne surprising result from the study is that the scientists found the toxins in honey samples from places like Tahiti, which aren't immediately associated with industrial farming.\r\nScientists say farmers in other parts of the world are being encouraged to use the pesticides as demand from Europe falls.\r\nGoulson believes the reason the neonicotinoids are worse than spraying pesticides because they damage the surrounding ecosystem.\r\nGlassborow's hives appear to be thriving.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/21aa6ead771ed86bb9a7285c16e99539 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(5 Oct 2017) LEADIN: \r\nA new report shows that 75 percent of honey samples tested from around the globe contain a key pesticide, linked to the decline in the number of bees.\r\nIt comes as Europe decides whether to enforce an outright ban on neuro toxic pesticides. \r\nSTORYLINE: \r\nAlways busy, bees are responsible for pollinating a third of all the food we eat.\r\nOur fruit and vegetables would not grow without them.\r\nBut a global study published by scientists at the University of Neuch\u00e2tel today (5 October 2017) shows we are contaminating bees, if not killing them.\r\nThe culprits are seven chemicals used in pesticides called neonicotinoids.\r\nAlthough there is no evidence to suggest they are harming humans, today's report published in the journal Science says the chemicals are now in bees and so probably in other pollinating insect populations worldwide.\r\nThe European Food Standards Agency is along with the EU parliament deciding what action to take.\r\nRichard Glassborow is the chairman of the London Beekeepers' Association.\r\nHe says: \"Well bees are insects, and pesticides are designed to take out pest insects, but they're pretty indiscriminate.\"\r\nThe EU introduced a partial ban on neonicotinoids in 2013, which outlawed their use on flowering crops such as sunflowers and oil seed rape, but they can still be used on other crops.  \r\nBees and other pollinators have been on the decline for more than a decade and experts blame a combination of factors: neonics, parasites, disease, climate change and lack of a diverse food supply. \r\nBees pick up the pesticide when they feed on fields grown from treated seeds.\r\nAs part of a citizen science project, the Swiss researchers asked other experts, friends and relatives to ship them honey samples. More than 300 samples arrived and researchers tested 198 of them for five of the most common types of neonics.\r\nOverall, 75 percent of the samples had at least one neonic, 45 percent had two or more and 10 percent had four or more.\r\nProfessor David Goulson, from the University of Sussex, is a peer commentator on the results of today's study: \"A worldwide survey of neonicotinoids in honey\".\r\nHe says: \"The majority of the samples contain concentrations which are high enough to have an effect on the bees, probably not to kill them, at least not quickly, so below the lethal dose, but enough to do them other forms of harm, so called sub-lethal effects. So we know for example these chemicals, they attack the brain of the insect and they interfere with their ability to learn and to navigate, which is really important for a bee. A honey bee and other kinds of bee they have to be able to find their way to and from patches of flowers and back to their hive and if they get lost then they're as good as dead.\"\r\nIt's not just the brains of the bees that are being messed up according to Goulson.\r\nHe says: \"Also we know these chemicals at low concentrations mess up the immune system of the honey bee so then they get infected with diseases, so the long and the short of it is that we should be worried about this, that it seems that a large proportion of the world's honey bees and probably other bees too are being continually exposed to toxins at a level that will be doing them harm.\"\r\nOne surprising result from the study is that the scientists found the toxins in honey samples from places like Tahiti, which aren't immediately associated with industrial farming.\r\nScientists say farmers in other parts of the world are being encouraged to use the pesticides as demand from Europe falls.\r\nGoulson believes the reason the neonicotinoids are worse than spraying pesticides because they damage the surrounding ecosystem.\r\nGlassborow's hives appear to be thriving.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/21aa6ead771ed86bb9a7285c16e99539 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Cars used to have a few buttons and knobs. Some vehicles now have as many as 50 buttons on the steering wheel and dashboards that are multi-functional. \r\nThere are touch screens, voice commands, writing pads, heads-up displays on windshields and mirrors, and 3-D computer-generated images.\r\nThe auto industry says the new systems are better alternatives for drivers than mobile phones and navigation devices that were not designed to be used while driving.\r\nJake Nelson, AAA's director for traffic safety advocacy and research says \"so these technologies have become more complex in that they allow drivers to do things that they couldn't do previously. Like in extreme cases interact with social media, search the Internet. But more common example might be to programme GPS navigation while also driving and in many vehicles today you're not able to do that. You have to programme your route before you hit the road. And that's of course what AAA recommends to do even if the technology is available to you to do it while driving.\" \r\nProgramming a destination into an in-vehicle GPS navigation system was the most distracting activity, taking drivers an average of 40 seconds to complete the task. \r\nAt 25 mph (40 kph), a car can travel the length of four football fields during the time it takes to enter a destination. \r\nPrevious research has shown that drivers who remove their eyes from the road for just two seconds double their risk for a crash.\r\nNelson says drivers testing all 30 of the 2017 model year cars and light trucks took their eyes off the road, and hands off the wheel, while using infotainment systems. \r\n\"One thing that was really surprising to me was that of all the systems that we evaluated 30 in this round. None of them allowed drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road for the duration of completing a particular task like tuning the radio that at some point in every process the driver is required to manually interact with the vehicle dashboard which usually comes with glances away from the roadway,\" says Nelson.\r\nThe test drivers used voice commands, touch screens and other interactive technologies to make calls, send texts, tune the radio or program navigation all while driving.\r\n\"We want drivers keep their hands on the wheel.

            "description": "(5 Oct 2017) LEADIN\r\nA BMW roadster that was once owned by Elvis Presley is on show in Berlin as part of the Motorworld Classics car fair. \r\nOther classic cars on display at the event include the original Ford Mustang Eleanor from the film \"Gone in 60 seconds\".\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nThis is one of the undisputed stars of this year's Motorworld Classics car fair in Berlin.\r\nIt's a BMW 507 roadster, made in 1955. The 8-cylinder, 150 horse powered car has a top speed of 205 kilometres per hour and the German car maker only produced 251 of them.\r\nA \"normal\" 507 Roadster will cost between 1.5 and 2.5 million euros, depending on the condition.\r\nBut this one is far from normal - it was once owned by Elvis Presley when he was stationed in Berlin as a US soldier.\r\nLegend has it that he had the car painted red because he got tired of women marking the vehicle with lipstick. A hint on the original red colour has intentionally been left in a small corner behind the driver's door.\r\n\"This is a car with three stories,\" explains Stefan Behr, spokesman for \"BMW classics\", part of the BMW brand that deals with classic cars.\r\n\"To start off, it was a show car at the IAA motor show (in Frankfurt in 1955). Secondly, Hans-Joachim Stueck (Formula One driver) drove this car. And finally, it was also owned by Elvis Presley.\"\r\nElvis Presley was stationed in Germany in 1958-1960 and to get around he bought the BMW 507 roadster.\r\nIn 2006 the car was found in a barn in California by Jackie Jouret, a journalist at Bimmer, a magazine focusing on BMW news.\r\nTracking the serial numbers she confirmed that the car was the same that Elvis drove around in Germany, and also the same as the one Formula One legend Hans-Joachim Stueck had driven.\r\nThe car was eventually sent to Munich in Germany where it was restored by Klaus Kutscher \u2013 an expert in vintage car restoration at BMW Group Classic\r\n\"It is priceless,\" says Behr.\r\n\"The Elvis 507 is not on the market. To know a price you would need to compare it to other products. But this one is not on the market, it is not going to get sold so therefore it is impossible to guess a price.\"\r\nAnother car with a thick sprinkle of stardust is this Ford Mustang Eleanor, made in 1967.\r\nIt is in itself a classic car, loved by collectors worldwide.\r\nBut this is the original car used in the movie \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" with Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie.\r\nIt was one of three Ford Mustang Eleanor vehicles on the set, and it has just been bought by Chrome Cars, based in Jena in Germany.\r\nThe company is planning on using it as a show car for the foreseeable future, but it says if the right buyer with the right offer comes along it would probably sell.\r\nThe company doesn't want to give a price, but Christian Zoellner, the sales manager for Chrome Cars, says that a copy of the same car recently sold for 1.5 million US dollars.\r\n\"Who would buy a car like this? It could be Mustang fans. It could be a collector that buys it as an investment. Or simply just a car enthusiast and fan. I think here you kill like seven birds with one stone. This car is probably not just for Mustang fans,\" he says.\r\nOne car with a similar price-tag is this Mercedes-Benz 300 SL coupe from 1954.\r\nThe sleek sports car is a classic and loved by collectors and enthusiasts.\r\nThis one, in a pristine condition, will set you back 1.5 million euros.\r\nAfter years of growth, the classic car market is still growing, according to Marc Baumueller, CEO of Motorworld.\r\n\"It is like the art market,\" he says.\r\n\"The vehicles are not made anymore so, therefore, the prices are increasing. But it will not always be like that. Just like in an art market the prices can both go up and down. But when you look at the development of the German market then you see that it has become an international market.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/11757570fc216c46cef2d908688e9f71 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(5 Oct 2017) LEADIN\r\nA BMW roadster that was once owned by Elvis Presley is on show in Berlin as part of the Motorworld Classics car fair. \r\nOther classic cars on display at the event include the original Ford Mustang Eleanor from the film \"Gone in 60 seconds\".\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nThis is one of the undisputed stars of this year's Motorworld Classics car fair in Berlin.\r\nIt's a BMW 507 roadster, made in 1955. The 8-cylinder, 150 horse powered car has a top speed of 205 kilometres per hour and the German car maker only produced 251 of them.\r\nA \"normal\" 507 Roadster will cost between 1.5 and 2.5 million euros, depending on the condition.\r\nBut this one is far from normal - it was once owned by Elvis Presley when he was stationed in Berlin as a US soldier.\r\nLegend has it that he had the car painted red because he got tired of women marking the vehicle with lipstick. A hint on the original red colour has intentionally been left in a small corner behind the driver's door.\r\n\"This is a car with three stories,\" explains Stefan Behr, spokesman for \"BMW classics\", part of the BMW brand that deals with classic cars.\r\n\"To start off, it was a show car at the IAA motor show (in Frankfurt in 1955). Secondly, Hans-Joachim Stueck (Formula One driver) drove this car. And finally, it was also owned by Elvis Presley.\"\r\nElvis Presley was stationed in Germany in 1958-1960 and to get around he bought the BMW 507 roadster.\r\nIn 2006 the car was found in a barn in California by Jackie Jouret, a journalist at Bimmer, a magazine focusing on BMW news.\r\nTracking the serial numbers she confirmed that the car was the same that Elvis drove around in Germany, and also the same as the one Formula One legend Hans-Joachim Stueck had driven.\r\nThe car was eventually sent to Munich in Germany where it was restored by Klaus Kutscher \u2013 an expert in vintage car restoration at BMW Group Classic\r\n\"It is priceless,\" says Behr.\r\n\"The Elvis 507 is not on the market. To know a price you would need to compare it to other products. But this one is not on the market, it is not going to get sold so therefore it is impossible to guess a price.\"\r\nAnother car with a thick sprinkle of stardust is this Ford Mustang Eleanor, made in 1967.\r\nIt is in itself a classic car, loved by collectors worldwide.\r\nBut this is the original car used in the movie \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" with Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie.\r\nIt was one of three Ford Mustang Eleanor vehicles on the set, and it has just been bought by Chrome Cars, based in Jena in Germany.\r\nThe company is planning on using it as a show car for the foreseeable future, but it says if the right buyer with the right offer comes along it would probably sell.\r\nThe company doesn't want to give a price, but Christian Zoellner, the sales manager for Chrome Cars, says that a copy of the same car recently sold for 1.5 million US dollars.\r\n\"Who would buy a car like this? It could be Mustang fans. It could be a collector that buys it as an investment. Or simply just a car enthusiast and fan. I think here you kill like seven birds with one stone. This car is probably not just for Mustang fans,\" he says.\r\nOne car with a similar price-tag is this Mercedes-Benz 300 SL coupe from 1954.\r\nThe sleek sports car is a classic and loved by collectors and enthusiasts.\r\nThis one, in a pristine condition, will set you back 1.5 million euros.\r\nAfter years of growth, the classic car market is still growing, according to Marc Baumueller, CEO of Motorworld.\r\n\"It is like the art market,\" he says.\r\n\"The vehicles are not made anymore so, therefore, the prices are increasing. But it will not always be like that. Just like in an art market the prices can both go up and down. But when you look at the development of the German market then you see that it has become an international market.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/11757570fc216c46cef2d908688e9f71 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
