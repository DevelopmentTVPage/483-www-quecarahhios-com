Thursday was the deadline for the 154,000 recipients eligible to reapply.\r\nThe rush of paperwork was prompted by the Trump's Administration's announcement in September that DACA would be phased out in March. Until then, the Trump Administration said Congress needed to address the issue of immigrants who were brought to this country by their parents as children. DACA was created by President Barack Obama in 2012 and nearly 700,000 immigrants were under the program.\r\n\"DACA has given so many opportunities for me and many of my other family members, to give us new jobs, a new shot at life,\" said Perla Montoya, who filled out her renewal application on Monday. \"\"Being a single mom with a four year old that has autism is really hard. Knowing that it could be the end of this for me, leaving my autistic child behind is really hard. It's really hard, watching the news, all my dreams coming down hill.\"\r\nAround the country immigrant advocacy organizations and legal aid offices deployed volunteers to help DACA recipients fill out their forms. In Washington state, an anonymous donor donated $125,000 to cover the $495 DACA renewal fee. \r\nBut under Trump's administration arrests of immigrants illegally in the country have increased, including those without criminal records and even some DACA recipients. The renewal process hasn't been without trepidation. \r\n \"I think one of the questions people have is 'should I be providing my address?'\" said Jorge Baron, executive director at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. \"Our advice is that we can't guarantee that information won't be used against them in the future. But on balance, if they don't have the risk factors, like criminal history or prior deportation orders, we think it's more of a benefit to move forward with the renewal than not.\"\r\nBeyond initial rumors of negotiations between Democrats and President Trump, Republican leadership in Congress has not signaled they will move forward with a fix. Meanwhile, young immigrants, often called Dreamers, have begun lobbying lawmakers to pass a bill, one that would not include more money for immigration enforcement.\r\nFor Montoya, she hopes to hear back soon on her renewal. Her DACA expires in December and she doesn't want to leave her job at Nordstrom's.    \r\n\"I woke up this morning with mixed emotions, not knowing if my application will go okay, will everything be okay? Just hoping that I'll get approved,\" Montoya said the day she filled out her application. \"Tons of mixed emotions, but overall very nervous because Homeland Security has our information.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/742bd7bf23c9f18731272e86417ac702 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Something clicked for Peddle, who owns B &amp; S Guns in Garland, Texas, when he heard shooter Stephen Paddock once lived in Mesquite, Texas, just a few miles from his shop.\r\nPeddle said he came in Monday, and searched Paddock's name in the sales system. \r\nHe said Paddock had purchased pistols and a revolver on several occasions in 2010 and 2011. \r\nPeddle said Paddock came into the shop with his girlfriend Marilou Danley in 2016, but did not buy anything on that visit.\r\n\"He never purchased any long guns here, nothing that would have been used in the attack,\" Peddle said.\r\n\"If you had to meet him the last time he was in here in 2016, you would never have an assumption that he was anything other than a very cordial extremely nice person,\" he said. \"He had his handgun license. He had everything. All the criteria was taken care of. So there was no immediate red flag up.\"\r\nAs he spoke, customers came in and out of the store. Peddle and his staff remembered all of them regardless of how long ago they had been in to shop. He asked one woman about her daughter's wedding and how the catering had gone. Peddle's bulldogs wander the store freely. Woody, his 11-month-old puppy greeted every customer Wednesday.\r\n\"We know everyone who comes in. It's just the kind of store we are. When we saw the photo of his girlfriend, we definitely remembered her,\" Peddle said. \"She sat on the floor for more than an hour and a half playing with my dogs. She loved them. I sent her photos of her playing with them to her phone.\"\r\nPeddle said Paddock asked questions during that 2016 visit, but did not make any purchases. \r\nHe said he asked about \"Trigger pulls\" and modifications he could make to his guns. Peddle said trigger pulls are used to lighten the spring on triggers.\r\nHe said the couple were very kind to each other, noting that Danley was walking with a \"tricked out\" cane with bedazzling on it because of a surgery. Peddle remembered Paddock walking her to the car and helping her get up.\r\n\"He was very charismatic with her, very sweet. That's the word I would use,\" he said. \"I didn't sense any tension. She couldn't really care at all about the guns. We could have been selling furniture and she wouldn't have cared. She was just in love with our puppies.\"\r\nPeddle said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms came to get his sales records Tuesday. \r\nHe said he didn't have the surveillance footage from 2016 because ATF had previously collected that footage for its investigation into the July 7 Dallas sniper attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3da8817c159dde5627653d644bb13f46 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Something clicked for Peddle, who owns B &amp; S Guns in Garland, Texas, when he heard shooter Stephen Paddock once lived in Mesquite, Texas, just a few miles from his shop.\r\nPeddle said he came in Monday, and searched Paddock's name in the sales system. \r\nHe said Paddock had purchased pistols and a revolver on several occasions in 2010 and 2011. \r\nPeddle said Paddock came into the shop with his girlfriend Marilou Danley in 2016, but did not buy anything on that visit.\r\n\"He never purchased any long guns here, nothing that would have been used in the attack,\" Peddle said.\r\n\"If you had to meet him the last time he was in here in 2016, you would never have an assumption that he was anything other than a very cordial extremely nice person,\" he said. \"He had his handgun license. He had everything. All the criteria was taken care of. So there was no immediate red flag up.\"\r\nAs he spoke, customers came in and out of the store. Peddle and his staff remembered all of them regardless of how long ago they had been in to shop. He asked one woman about her daughter's wedding and how the catering had gone. Peddle's bulldogs wander the store freely. Woody, his 11-month-old puppy greeted every customer Wednesday.\r\n\"We know everyone who comes in. It's just the kind of store we are. When we saw the photo of his girlfriend, we definitely remembered her,\" Peddle said. \"She sat on the floor for more than an hour and a half playing with my dogs. She loved them. I sent her photos of her playing with them to her phone.\"\r\nPeddle said Paddock asked questions during that 2016 visit, but did not make any purchases. \r\nHe said he asked about \"Trigger pulls\" and modifications he could make to his guns. Peddle said trigger pulls are used to lighten the spring on triggers.\r\nHe said the couple were very kind to each other, noting that Danley was walking with a \"tricked out\" cane with bedazzling on it because of a surgery. Peddle remembered Paddock walking her to the car and helping her get up.\r\n\"He was very charismatic with her, very sweet. That's the word I would use,\" he said. \"I didn't sense any tension. She couldn't really care at all about the guns. We could have been selling furniture and she wouldn't have cared. She was just in love with our puppies.\"\r\nPeddle said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms came to get his sales records Tuesday. \r\nHe said he didn't have the surveillance footage from 2016 because ATF had previously collected that footage for its investigation into the July 7 Dallas sniper attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/770321f4de3bacbd41f78d0dfb234e49 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
