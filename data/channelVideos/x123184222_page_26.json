Police have been ordered to stop ballots from being cast on Sunday and have been cracking down for days, confiscating ballots and posters.\r\nCatalonia's defiant regional government is pressing ahead despite the ban and the police crackdown, urging the region's 5.3 million registered voters to make their voices heard.\r\nCatalan authorities have pledged to make the voting possible even if police, acting on judges' orders, manages to close polling stations and seal off ballot boxes. \r\nIf a 'yes' vote wins, they have promised to declare independence within 48 hours. \r\nNo minimum participation has been set, but regional president Carles Puigdemont has acknowledged that a significant turnout will be needed for declaring the results legitimate.\r\nThe Spanish government says the vote, which has been ordered suspended by the Constitutional Court, is illegal and will not take place. \r\nTo this end, it ordered thousands of police reinforcements that are being housed in ferries in Barcelona port, raising tension in the region that is one of Europe's most popular tourist destinations.\r\nBut it's hard to see how a vote will take place as millions of ballot papers have been seized and police have been ordered to make sure no polling centre stays open. \r\nThere is no electoral board in place but Catalan authorities say polls will open and votes will be counted.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/df77a33494ae6598eaaa9ef35d34c2df \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Police have been ordered to stop ballots from being cast on Sunday and have been cracking down for days, confiscating ballots and posters.\r\nCatalonia's defiant regional government is pressing ahead despite the ban and the police crackdown, urging the region's 5.3 million registered voters to make their voices heard.\r\nCatalan authorities have pledged to make the voting possible even if police, acting on judges' orders, manages to close polling stations and seal off ballot boxes. \r\nIf a 'yes' vote wins, they have promised to declare independence within 48 hours. \r\nNo minimum participation has been set, but regional president Carles Puigdemont has acknowledged that a significant turnout will be needed for declaring the results legitimate.\r\nThe Spanish government says the vote, which has been ordered suspended by the Constitutional Court, is illegal and will not take place. \r\nTo this end, it ordered thousands of police reinforcements that are being housed in ferries in Barcelona port, raising tension in the region that is one of Europe's most popular tourist destinations.\r\nBut it's hard to see how a vote will take place as millions of ballot papers have been seized and police have been ordered to make sure no polling centre stays open. \r\nThere is no electoral board in place but Catalan authorities say polls will open and votes will be counted.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/df77a33494ae6598eaaa9ef35d34c2df \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(30 Sep 2017) US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is in China for weekend discussions focused on trade and North Korea, along with preparations for an anticipated visit by US President Donald Trump in November\r\nHe is calling for a calming of the situation on the Korean Peninsula, but also says it is incumbent on North Korea to halt its missile launches.\r\nFollowing meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other officials in Beijing, Tillerson said he believes China has become deeply concerned about the North's missile and nuclear programs and is working hard to convince Pyongyang to re-enter talks, but did not say specifically what form those talks should take.\r\nAsked whether that should apply to recent pointed remarks from President Donald Trump, Tillerson replied: \"I think the whole situation is a bit overheated right now. I think everyone would like for it to calm down.\r\nTies between Beijing and Washington are considered more crucial than ever with the standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles entering a new, more dangerous phase as its leader, Kim Jong Un, and Trump exchange personal insults and threats of war with no sign of a diplomatic solution.\r\nTrump has been pressing for tougher measures on Pyongyang from China, the North's chief trading partner and source of aid and diplomatic support.  \r\nAlthough adamantly opposed to steps that could bring down Kim's regime, Beijing appears increasingly willing to tighten the screws on Pyongyang, and agreed to tough new United Nations sanctions that would substantially cut foreign revenue for the isolated North.\r\nTillerson reiterated Saturday that the U.S. would not recognize North Korea as a nuclear power, but said it also had no intention of overthrowing Kim's regime.\r\nIn opening remarks at his meeting with Xi, Tillerson said relations between the sides continue to \"grow and mature on the strength of the relationship between yourself and President Trump.\"\r\nEarlier, Tillerson told top Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi that a strong relationship between Trump and Xi bode well for dealing with political and economic differences between the two countries.\r\nTrump's visit, Tillerson said, also provided an opportunity to assess progress made between the sides since Xi and Trump met in April at the U.S. president's estate in Florida.\r\nThere they agreed to a 100-day plan for trade talks. After visiting China this week, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said there's been some progress, including a deal to let U.S. beef into China, but they need to tackle \"bigger things and more difficult things.\" The U.S. priorities are better market access, less protectionism and protecting intellectual property rights.\r\nTillerson is making his second visit as secretary of state to the world's No. 2 economy and chief American rival for influence in Asia, and increasingly, the world. Along with Xi and Yang, he met with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who told Tillerson that China-U.S. relations \"overall have a positive momentum and have arrived at an important opportunity to progress further.\"\r\nOn Thursday, Beijing ordered North Korean-owned businesses and ventures with Chinese partners to close by early January, days after it said it would cut off gas and limit shipments of refined petroleum products, effective Jan. 1. It made no mention of crude oil, which makes up the bulk of Chinese energy supplies to North Korea and is not covered by the U.N. sanctions.\r\nChina has also banned imports of North Korean coal, iron and lead ore, and seafood since early September.\r\nTrump's planned visit to China in November will come just weeks after Xi is expected to receive a new five-year term as leader of the ruling Communist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c8534897ae706c8c11dcbd9f790e839e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

So the equipment was no longer needed in manufacturing, it was passed to this shop, and everyone who wanted it, bought it. I bought such things there.\"\r\nWhen Basargin found out about the opening of the museum, he decided to make dozens of his collectibles a part of computer history, picking them up off the dusty shelves and donating them to Skynet.\r\nYear by year it becomes more difficult to find old Soviet computers - most people have thrown out old hardware.\r\n\"We have several dozens of Soviet computers here,\" says Martyanov. \r\n\"Actually, there were a lot of various computers produced in the Soviet Union, and the engineering industry kept pace with the times, striving to replicate and improve exhibits, so to improve those developments from abroad.\"\r\nWhile computers today can fit in the palm of our hands, those of the past were a much larger operation.\r\nMartyanov switches on an old computer and the whirring of the fan starts up.\r\n\"There were five of those fans in a single cupboard. And there could be a few dozens of the cupboards in a big room. All of this was a single computer,\" he says, marvelling at the thought.\r\n\"The place where the computer was located was called a machine hall. You can imagine what noise was made by one cupboard and what noise was in a room where the computer was installed.\"\r\nToday, these old devices make today's users laugh: calculators were bigger than modern tablets and units looked more like chandeliers stuffed with lamps.\r\nEvery month up to 4000 people come to Skynet, most of them are students of local schools and colleges. \r\nThe most popular part of the exhibition is the gaming zone.\r\nThese youngsters are trying out video games.\r\nThey can't understand how people used the devices in the past.\r\nBut the gaming zone also features more up-to-date technology.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/43f1975ad52788238ea660ac4d6fe988 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
