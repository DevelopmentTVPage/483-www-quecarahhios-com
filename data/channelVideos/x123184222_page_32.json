            "description": "(1 Aug 2017) Brazilian President Michel Temer will face on Wednesday a vote in Congress' lower house on whether he should be suspended and put on trial over a bribery charge filed against him by the attorney general.\r\nOpposition lawmakers feel confident he will be suspended sooner or later, either this week with the bribery charge vote or in a likely obstruction of justice accusation that Attorney General Rodrigo Janot could bring before the end of the month. The latter would bring its own vote by the Chamber of Deputies.\r\nTemer has been using much of his political capital to curry support ahead of Wednesday's vote, including, some analysts say, the promising of billions of dollars in earmarked appropriations for many legislators at a time the country is struggling to emerge from its worst recession in decades.\r\nIn the capital's airport passengers were received at the arrival gates by a handful protesters wearing masks resembling Temer offering to buy votes with fake 100 reals bills. \r\nTemer is accused of receiving bribes indirectly, via a confidant who was caught by police carrying a suitcase with about $150,000 in cash. \r\nThe case erupted in May when a recording emerged in which Temer apparently tells a meat-packing company executive to keep up paying of hush money to former Chamber of Deputies Speaker Eduardo Cunha, who is serving a 15-year sentence for corruption.\r\nTemer has denied wrongdoing and he adamantly rejected calls for him to resign from across the political spectrum.\r\nUntil a few weeks ago, the president appeared to have an ample margin of support among the 513 members of the Chamber of Deputies.\r\nLast week, an Ibope institute opinion poll said just 5 percent of Brazilians surveyed approved of Temer.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/192b8b2eeaf443b83bf87823694654b1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(1 Aug 2017) Brazilian President Michel Temer will face on Wednesday a vote in Congress' lower house on whether he should be suspended and put on trial over a bribery charge filed against him by the attorney general.\r\nOpposition lawmakers feel confident he will be suspended sooner or later, either this week with the bribery charge vote or in a likely obstruction of justice accusation that Attorney General Rodrigo Janot could bring before the end of the month. The latter would bring its own vote by the Chamber of Deputies.\r\nTemer has been using much of his political capital to curry support ahead of Wednesday's vote, including, some analysts say, the promising of billions of dollars in earmarked appropriations for many legislators at a time the country is struggling to emerge from its worst recession in decades.\r\nIn the capital's airport passengers were received at the arrival gates by a handful protesters wearing masks resembling Temer offering to buy votes with fake 100 reals bills. \r\nTemer is accused of receiving bribes indirectly, via a confidant who was caught by police carrying a suitcase with about $150,000 in cash. \r\nThe case erupted in May when a recording emerged in which Temer apparently tells a meat-packing company executive to keep up paying of hush money to former Chamber of Deputies Speaker Eduardo Cunha, who is serving a 15-year sentence for corruption.\r\nTemer has denied wrongdoing and he adamantly rejected calls for him to resign from across the political spectrum.\r\nUntil a few weeks ago, the president appeared to have an ample margin of support among the 513 members of the Chamber of Deputies.\r\nLast week, an Ibope institute opinion poll said just 5 percent of Brazilians surveyed approved of Temer.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/192b8b2eeaf443b83bf87823694654b1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
