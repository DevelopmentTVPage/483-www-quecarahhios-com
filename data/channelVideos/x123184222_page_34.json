            "description": "(2 Aug 2017) LEADIN:\r\nRefugee children, including those from Syria, who live in camps around Athens in Greece have taken part in a concert at the ancient Theatre of Herodes of Atticus.\r\nThe concert was part of the 'Athens and Epidaurus Festival' and was run by the Sistema Europe Youth Orchestra (SEYO), part of the worldwide music organisation El Sistema.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nThis young lady is about to have her moment in the spotlight.\r\nShe and some of the other children from Skaramagas Camp in Piraeus, Athens are getting ready to perform.\r\nThey are travelling by bus to the ancient Theatre of Herodes of Atticus, which sits next to the Acropolis in Athens.\r\nGamkin Abdo, a 12 year old boy from Syria, is going too.\r\nThe children sing on the bus and are happy and excited to be at the venue.\r\nInside Gamkin says singing and taking part in the concert makes him feel great.\r\n\"I feel good when I am going to the concert. Now I am going to a concert and it's good, and when I sing I feel better, I feel like something.\"\r\nThe concert is part of the worldwide El Sistema music movement.\r\nEl Sistema is a music education programme, which was initially founded in Venezuela, and has since spread to 55 countries. \r\nAccording to the El Sistema USA website, \"El Sistema is a tested model of how a music program can both create great musicians and dramatically change the life trajectory of hundreds of thousands of a nation's neediest kids.\"\r\nIn Greece the mission of El Sistema is to use music as tool for integration. \r\nThe El Sistema Greece programme started in November 2016 and offers a free music programme to refugees. \r\nFounder of El Sistema, Greece Anis Barnat says hosting the concert at the theatre brings people together.\r\n\"It's one of the most ancient theatres in the world, and here Athens is of course the birth of democracy. So coming here is very, very symbolic, We want to show that that all these kids from so many different origins, nationalities, religions, they can do something all together, and be in the same tune.\"\r\nBarnat says the orchestra and choir are tools the children use for wider learning.\r\n\"Music is only an excuse, but with music you can learn so many different things.

            "description": "(2 Aug 2017) LEADIN:\r\nFrance's famous lavender fields are suffering, blighted by drought and disease-carrying insects. \r\nScientists and farmers in Provence are now taking steps to preserve this symbol of their region, which is precious source of income for many.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nLavender as far as the eye can see, its heady scent attracting insects and tourists alike. \r\nThese vast purple fields have become a symbol of the region of Provence, in southeastern France. \r\nCommercially, these crops are sought-after by the perfume and cosmetics industry and they are an important draw for tourists. \r\nTwo types of lavender are commonly cultivated in France, Lavandula angustifolia and the hybrid lavender plants known as lavandins (lavandula x intermedia).\r\nBut Provence's lavender is feeling the impact of climate change.\r\nSince the early 2000s, local scientists say dry weather has been shortening the lavender's lifespan.\r\nThe dry conditions also create a favourable environment for leafhoppers, insects that carry a disease that affects the plants. \r\nEric Chaisse is the Technical and Administrative Director of Crieppam, a Provence-based scientific institute dedicated to agricultural research, which is part-funded by the \r\nFrench Agriculture Ministry. \r\n\"Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rainfall in the spring and mostly in the autumn,\" he says. \r\n\"This played a role on the lavender's lifespan. There's also a small cicada (insect), a micro-bacteria transmitting leafhopper. It adapts itself very well to the dryness and it becomes more numerous with very dry weather.\"\r\nThe problem is immediately obvious in this field at harvest season. \r\nThe once seamless rows of lavender are now separated by large holes, which are getting bigger as the lavender plants keep shrinking.\r\nAn even closer look reveals the weakened plants grow fewer flowers than healthier versions.  \r\n\"Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller plant ears. The ear is underdeveloped and is either missing or weakened, so so we have a lot fewer of the noble parts of the plant that are the source of the essential oil,\" says Chaisse. \r\nThe situation is made worse by a leafhopper insect that carries phytoplasma, a bacterial parasite that attacks the plant tissue. \r\n\"The leafhopper is responsible for directly transmitting the phytoplasma disease. This illness sets in on healthy plants, infects them and grows into the plant, in the sap, slowly causing its death,\" Chaisse explains. \r\nPlants affected by the condition turn a pale green or yellowish colour and produce smaller leaves with no flowers, says Chaisse. \r\nThe deterioration of lavender plants started with a series of dry weather spells between 2003 and 2007, he says. \r\nThe region enjoyed more rainfall from 2012 to 2014, but drought hit the lavender again last year. \r\nA lack of rainfall during the autumn of 2016 and this past spring further exacerbated the situation, leading to a higher plant mortality, says Chaisse. \r\nTypical of Mediterranean areas, lavender historically plays an important role in the economy of Provence, with almost 26,000 producers directly or indirectly involved in the lavender industry.\r\nThe region is also internationally renowned for its production of essential oils obtained from the distillation of lavender plants.\r\nJean-Marie Naud is a farmer producing Lavandula angustifolia and lavandin in the village of Eurre, in southeastern France. \r\nNaud started cultivating the plant 25 years ago. \r\nIn order to preserve its purity, he says, he's adopted traditional methods that include harvesting by hand. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/86b868435c7b08d1c54e3e563235b446 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(2 Aug 2017) LEADIN:\r\nFrance's famous lavender fields are suffering, blighted by drought and disease-carrying insects. \r\nScientists and farmers in Provence are now taking steps to preserve this symbol of their region, which is precious source of income for many.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nLavender as far as the eye can see, its heady scent attracting insects and tourists alike. \r\nThese vast purple fields have become a symbol of the region of Provence, in southeastern France. \r\nCommercially, these crops are sought-after by the perfume and cosmetics industry and they are an important draw for tourists. \r\nTwo types of lavender are commonly cultivated in France, Lavandula angustifolia and the hybrid lavender plants known as lavandins (lavandula x intermedia).\r\nBut Provence's lavender is feeling the impact of climate change.\r\nSince the early 2000s, local scientists say dry weather has been shortening the lavender's lifespan.\r\nThe dry conditions also create a favourable environment for leafhoppers, insects that carry a disease that affects the plants. \r\nEric Chaisse is the Technical and Administrative Director of Crieppam, a Provence-based scientific institute dedicated to agricultural research, which is part-funded by the \r\nFrench Agriculture Ministry. \r\n\"Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rainfall in the spring and mostly in the autumn,\" he says. \r\n\"This played a role on the lavender's lifespan. There's also a small cicada (insect), a micro-bacteria transmitting leafhopper. It adapts itself very well to the dryness and it becomes more numerous with very dry weather.\"\r\nThe problem is immediately obvious in this field at harvest season. \r\nThe once seamless rows of lavender are now separated by large holes, which are getting bigger as the lavender plants keep shrinking.\r\nAn even closer look reveals the weakened plants grow fewer flowers than healthier versions.  \r\n\"Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller plant ears. The ear is underdeveloped and is either missing or weakened, so so we have a lot fewer of the noble parts of the plant that are the source of the essential oil,\" says Chaisse. \r\nThe situation is made worse by a leafhopper insect that carries phytoplasma, a bacterial parasite that attacks the plant tissue. \r\n\"The leafhopper is responsible for directly transmitting the phytoplasma disease. This illness sets in on healthy plants, infects them and grows into the plant, in the sap, slowly causing its death,\" Chaisse explains. \r\nPlants affected by the condition turn a pale green or yellowish colour and produce smaller leaves with no flowers, says Chaisse. \r\nThe deterioration of lavender plants started with a series of dry weather spells between 2003 and 2007, he says. \r\nThe region enjoyed more rainfall from 2012 to 2014, but drought hit the lavender again last year. \r\nA lack of rainfall during the autumn of 2016 and this past spring further exacerbated the situation, leading to a higher plant mortality, says Chaisse. \r\nTypical of Mediterranean areas, lavender historically plays an important role in the economy of Provence, with almost 26,000 producers directly or indirectly involved in the lavender industry.\r\nThe region is also internationally renowned for its production of essential oils obtained from the distillation of lavender plants.\r\nJean-Marie Naud is a farmer producing Lavandula angustifolia and lavandin in the village of Eurre, in southeastern France. \r\nNaud started cultivating the plant 25 years ago. \r\nIn order to preserve its purity, he says, he's adopted traditional methods that include harvesting by hand. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/86b868435c7b08d1c54e3e563235b446 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

There's also a small cicada (insect), a micro-bacteria transmitting leafhopper. It adapts itself very well to the dryness and it becomes more numerous with very dry weather.\"\r\nThe problem is immediately obvious in this field at harvest season. \r\nThe once seamless rows of lavender are now separated by large holes, which are getting bigger as the lavender plants keep shrinking.\r\nAn even closer look reveals the weakened plants grow fewer flowers than healthier versions.  \r\n\"Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller plant ears. The ear is underdeveloped and is either missing or weakened, so so we have a lot fewer of the noble parts of the plant that are the source of the essential oil,\" says Chaisse. \r\nThe situation is made worse by a leafhopper insect that carries phytoplasma, a bacterial parasite that attacks the plant tissue. \r\n\"The leafhopper is responsible for directly transmitting the phytoplasma disease. This illness sets in on healthy plants, infects them and grows into the plant, in the sap, slowly causing its death,\" Chaisse explains. \r\nPlants affected by the condition turn a pale green or yellowish colour and produce smaller leaves with no flowers, says Chaisse. \r\nThe deterioration of lavender plants started with a series of dry weather spells between 2003 and 2007, he says. \r\nThe region enjoyed more rainfall from 2012 to 2014, but drought hit the lavender again last year. \r\nA lack of rainfall during the autumn of 2016 and this past spring further exacerbated the situation, leading to a higher plant mortality, says Chaisse. \r\nTypical of Mediterranean areas, lavender historically plays an important role in the economy of Provence, with almost 26,000 producers directly or indirectly involved in the lavender industry.\r\nThe region is also internationally renowned for its production of essential oils obtained from the distillation of lavender plants.\r\nJean-Marie Naud is a farmer producing Lavandula angustifolia and lavandin in the village of Eurre, in southeastern France. \r\nNaud started cultivating the plant 25 years ago. \r\nIn order to preserve its purity, he says, he's adopted traditional methods that include harvesting by hand. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/f804c490591752ae7fce46c6af90c8e1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
