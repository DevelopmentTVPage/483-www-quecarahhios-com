With her famous headscarf, rosy cheeks and long eye-lashes, the Russian nesting doll is recognised the world over.\r\nFirst made at the beginning of the 19th century the doll, which contains 6 smaller versions of itself, is a much loved child's toy and a popular souvenir.\r\nHandmade, no two Matryoshkas are identical. The word  \"Matryoshka\" is a diminutive of the female name Matrena, which comes from the Latin word matron, meaning \"mother\".\r\n\"Speaking as a whole the Matryoshka is the symbol of motherhood, it is the symbol of womanhood. Truly what today we call the 'Russian Spirit',\" says Alena Shapovalova, an historian from the Art History Museum of Semenov.\r\nThe Semenov Matryoshka doll is probably one of the best known of the dolls. Made by hand in the town of Semenov in the Nizhny Novgorod region it takes at least 7 days to make just one.\r\nIt goes through numerous hands during the process, from making to painting and polishing.\r\nThe painting process alone involves the painstaking work of several painters in three stages, each applying a new layer.\r\n\"The first artist applies the features to the Matryoshka doll, that means she draws the face, the hands, the headscarf, the Sarafan (traditional Russian\/ Slavic attire). The Matryoshka doll ends up looking like this. The next operation is taken up by the covering painter and she begins to cover the Matryoshka doll. Our traditional Matryoshka doll has a yellow headscarf and red Sarafan. Also we have this little pattern here we call the chessboard. It is our traditional trademark. After the Matryoshka doll has been covered and touched up, the next painter takes it up in her hands and begins to paint the flowers. She fills out the apron with flowers, so it looks like the Matryoshka doll is holding a bouquet in her hands and also the edge of the headscarf,\" explains Matryoshka painter Irina Kosterina.\r\nAll the hard work is definitely worth it as they continue to delight and intrigue tourists from all over the world.\r\n\"In the States we don't have them typically, you know,\" explains US tourist Jamie Fishenberry. \"So that is something, at least for Americans, we think of tourists, souvenirs, they are really common, very popular.\"\r\nMeanwhile Indian tourist Panjali Mukhaji says: \"If I am going back to my home I would like to take a Matryoshka from here because it represents Russia traditionally.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5defc5980f45b67c0a1e6c595faf3a2c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Visitors soak in 40-degree bubbling beer, yeast and hops.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nThe tiny Icelandic village of Arskogssandur, around 400 kilometres northeast of Reykjavik, is home to the country's oldest working microbrewery.\r\nBut since June, it's had a new neighbour - the volcanic country's first beer spa.\r\nBjorbodin Spa houses seven indoor beer tubs, they're large enough to fit two people each. It is for adults only.\r\nBut don't try drinking it - beer baths are warmed to 40 degrees-Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) meaning most of the alcohol evaporates.\r\nSoffia Sigurdasdottir is Bjorbodin Spa's head beautician. She claims there are many benefits to being submerged in warm beer. \r\n\"In the beer baths we use fresh water from our mountains, young beer, brewed yeast and hops,\" she says. \r\n\"The yeast and the young beer is specially rich and has high level of almost the whole range of vitamin B, which is revitalising for skin and hair. \r\n\"And the hops have high levels of anti-oxidants, which are really good for the skin as well as have a good effect on the PH of your body.\"\r\nBathtubs are equipped with a tap of Kaldi, the local larger produced at the brewery next door.\r\nSpa visitor Thorsteinn Ragnarsson is a business entrepreneur from the nearby city of Akureyri.\r\n\"It's a very new experience for me,\" he says.\r\n\"I have never thought about beer as something to bathe in. I've always thought about beer just as something to drink. And then I heard about the benefits of the beer bathing and I just had to try it out.\"\r\nBeer spas are particularly popular in the Czech Republic, where there is a rich tradition of beer breweries and accompanying spas.\r\nAnother visitor, Dana Antonsdottir is a worker from a nearby village.\r\n\"I feel very relaxed, the first thing,\" she says. \r\n\"And I don't know how to put words on it, it's soft and relaxed. Like yeah.\"\r\nIt's claimed the effect on the skin is best enhanced by not showering off the liquid until some hours later.\r\nAfter soaking in the tub, guests are sent to a relaxation room for around 25 minutes to let the liquids soak in.\r\nBut the spa recommends waiting several hours before showering.\r\nA single bath is priced at 6,900 Icelandic kroner (approx. $65 USD).

She claims there are many benefits to being submerged in warm beer. \r\n\"In the beer baths we use fresh water from our mountains, young beer, brewed yeast and hops,\" she says. \r\n\"The yeast and the young beer is specially rich and has high level of almost the whole range of vitamin B, which is revitalising for skin and hair. \r\n\"And the hops have high levels of anti-oxidants, which are really good for the skin as well as have a good effect on the PH of your body.\"\r\nBathtubs are equipped with a tap of Kaldi, the local larger produced at the brewery next door.\r\nSpa visitor Thorsteinn Ragnarsson is a business entrepreneur from the nearby city of Akureyri.\r\n\"It's a very new experience for me,\" he says.\r\n\"I have never thought about beer as something to bathe in. I've always thought about beer just as something to drink. And then I heard about the benefits of the beer bathing and I just had to try it out.\"\r\nBeer spas are particularly popular in the Czech Republic, where there is a rich tradition of beer breweries and accompanying spas.\r\nAnother visitor, Dana Antonsdottir is a worker from a nearby village.\r\n\"I feel very relaxed, the first thing,\" she says. \r\n\"And I don't know how to put words on it, it's soft and relaxed. Like yeah.\"\r\nIt's claimed the effect on the skin is best enhanced by not showering off the liquid until some hours later.\r\nAfter soaking in the tub, guests are sent to a relaxation room for around 25 minutes to let the liquids soak in.\r\nBut the spa recommends waiting several hours before showering.\r\nA single bath is priced at 6,900 Icelandic kroner (approx. $65 USD).

The blast occurred amid a traffic jam while soldiers were searching cars at a nearby intersection.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/879e2499b8e1d1dce145dcd4bed87c57 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
