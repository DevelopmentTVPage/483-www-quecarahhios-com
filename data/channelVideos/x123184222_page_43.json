The poem contains the famous words: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\"   \r\nMiller's comments about the poem, \"The Great Colossus,\" by Emma Lazarus, came in defense of President Donald Trump's proposal to dramatically reduce legal immigration and shift the nation toward a system that prioritizes merit and skills over family ties. \r\nMiller noted, correctly, that the poem was not originally on the Statue of Liberty. \r\nBut Lazarus' words have since been widely absorbed in American culture and helped make the statue synonymous with welcoming people from abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5a4e980fc23be1dcc78de10b356fcc7f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
