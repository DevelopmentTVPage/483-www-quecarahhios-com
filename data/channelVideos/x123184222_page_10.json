These are from 3,500 BC. Tel Es-Sakan site is one of the most important in Palestine, 3500 years old, which means 1,000 before the pyramids. We also have discovered camel bones here,\" he says.\r\nAl-A'utul shows salvaged fragments that he used to reassemble two thirds of a jar. He's also found a flint knife blade and camel bones.\r\nHamas is flattening the hill on the southern tip of Gaza City to make way for military bases and construction projects. \r\nAl-A'utul fears that the ancient ruins will be completely destroyed if nothing is done to preserve them.\r\n\"If this way of bulldozing, trucks and playing in the place continues, this place will be gone, erased...it will disappear,\" says al A'utul.\r\nThe site was accidentally discovered in 1990s when an expedition by French archaeologist Jean-Baptiste Humbert found the fortified settlement hidden in the the 10-hectare (25-acre) hill.\r\nThe settlement predates pharaonic rule on Egypt by centuries and the pyramids by a 1000 years.\r\nIn 2002, the French excavations stopped because of a Palestinian uprising in which protesters violently clashed with Israeli military posts.\r\nGaza is home to numerous ancient treasures. But, beyond the hot weather and urban sprawl, Gaza's unique political landscape has long complicated archaeological work.\r\nWith little open space in Gaza, a fast-growing population and an economy stifled by Israeli and Egyptian blockades, Hamas officials say they have no choice but to develop the area, making archaeology a low priority. \r\nDozens of ancient sites have been found in Gaza and excavations have revealed temples, monasteries, palaces, churches and mosques and mosaics from the Bronze Age and through the Byzantine, Greek, Roman and Islamic eras.\r\nBut most of these sites have disappeared. UNESCO is struggling to preserve some of remaining ones. \r\n \"I believe that what is going on and what happened in Tel Es-Sakan, which is also an important archaeological site is disastrous for the archaeology and cultural heritage in Palestine as it's also for its identity, identity of its people. So, it's of course an important concern for UNESCO and we already conveyed this concern to the relevant authorities,\" says  Junaid Sorosh-Wali, a UNESCO official in Palestinian Territories.\r\nIn 2009 and 2012, the expansion of universities destroyed the western and northern facades of Tel El-Sakan. \r\nPeople displaced during three wars between Hamas and Israel set up temporary dwellings on the eastern side. \r\nThe southern front remained, but Hamas authorities decided to flatten it. \r\nThe bulldozer work started in early August. \r\nHumbert, with the help of colleagues from Gaza's Islamic University, succeeded in stopping the work for two weeks while the\r\nministry and Hamas' Land Authority tried to settle the dispute syrrounding the ruins. \r\nJamal Abu Rida, the ministry's director of antiquities, says Tel Es-Sakan is a protected archaeological site under the auspices of his ministry, but that couldn't stop the more powerful Land Authority from destroying the final 1.2 hectares (three acres) of the site. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/2de7afb04b4013aa2bfa0d06ca72c33d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Catalan farmers drove their tractors along a street in the centre of Barcelona on Friday in favour of Catalan citizens' right to vote in a referendum on independence.\r\nIt came as Spain's government cabinet spokesman says there will not be a referendum on Catalonia's independence on Sunday as announced by the regional Catalan government.\r\nCulture Minister Inigo Mendez de Vigo accuses the secessionist coalition ruling the northeastern region of bending the laws to go ahead with a vote regardless of warnings from courts and a suspension by the country's Constitutional Court earlier this month.\r\n\"This is a demonstration so that the world understands with more strength that on the 1st of October we will vote and we will vote freely,\" said 53-year-old farmer Giner Pinyols.\r\nCatalan authorities say they will declare independence within 48 hours after announcing the vote's results if the yes wins. \r\nThe Spanish government has fought the referendum with a myriad of legal actions that have been criticised by many in Catalonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/0dfbd17ebc51fc3c55db59e536431bf8 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

But, beyond the hot weather and urban sprawl, Gaza's unique political landscape has long complicated archaeological work.\r\nWith little open space in Gaza, a fast-growing population and an economy stifled by Israeli and Egyptian blockades, Hamas officials say they have no choice but to develop the area, making archaeology a low priority. \r\nDozens of ancient sites have been found in Gaza and excavations have revealed temples, monasteries, palaces, churches and mosques and mosaics from the Bronze Age and through the Byzantine, Greek, Roman and Islamic eras.\r\nBut most of these sites have disappeared.

So yards like Princess, Sunseeker, Fairline, Oyster, Pendennis down in Falmouth, they're going okay because suddenly forego buyers are finding their products are a lot cheaper.\"\r\nPlymouth-based Princess Yachts is showcasing three yachts in Monaco, including this 35-metre White Dream that was launched this year.\r\nPrincess executive chairman Antony Sheriff claims recent success shouldn't just be attributed to a weak pound.\r\n\"It's a transient thing,\" he says. \r\n\"You can call it the Brexit discount, but I like to think for the three years previous it was the euro discount because we're actually just at the same euro to pound exchange rate that we were three years ago. \r\n\"So our euro competitors had a short term benefit and now we're back to normality, let's say.\"\r\nPrincess prides itself on crafting every single part of its luxurious yachts in-house, at its Plymouth shipyards.\r\nWhat might prove a challenge to the yacht maker would be a clean break, or so-called \"Hard Brexit\", from the 28 bloc EU.\r\n\"That would be very bad news,\" admits Sheriff. \r\n\"We are very much a global company, we sell our boats literally all over the world, we source components from all over the world and natural blockages which would see components held up in customs with tariffs really is not in the interests of competition.\r\n\"And it's not in the interest of running a high-quality business and it's certainly not in the interest of maintaining high employment in the UK.\"\r\n\"Uncertainty is bad for business generally and consumer confidence,\" says Howard Pridding from British Marine.\r\n\"But we are strong at the moment, we are optimistic and we will continue to do the business while politicians talk about Brexit.\"\r\nPoole-based Sunseeker Yachts is also exhibiting in Monaco, showcasing a total of three yachts, including this 35-metre 116. \r\n\"Buying a luxury yacht is a 100 percent discretionary purchase,\" says Sunseeker CEO Phil Popham. \r\n\"No one needs yachts, it's about their leisure life, it's about their private life and although the weakness of the pound has in the short term made us more competitive against some of our foreign based manufacturers, foreign based competitors, it's not an impulse purchase and so I don' think the impact of the weak pound is going to be beneficial for a long period of time.\"\r\nLast week, British Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain was prepared to abide by European Union rules and pay in to the bloc's coffers for two years after leaving the EU in March 2019.\r\n\"What we really do want is a level of certainty and stability,\" he says. \r\nThe annual Monaco Yacht Show runs 27-30 September.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/7be346437fa2e45f7d2436806e742105 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

So yards like Princess, Sunseeker, Fairline, Oyster, Pendennis down in Falmouth, they're going okay because suddenly forego buyers are finding their products are a lot cheaper.\"\r\nPlymouth-based Princess Yachts is showcasing three yachts in Monaco, including this 35-metre White Dream that was launched this year.\r\nPrincess executive chairman Antony Sheriff claims recent success shouldn't just be attributed to a weak pound.\r\n\"It's a transient thing,\" he says. \r\n\"You can call it the Brexit discount, but I like to think for the three years previous it was the euro discount because we're actually just at the same euro to pound exchange rate that we were three years ago. \r\n\"So our euro competitors had a short term benefit and now we're back to normality, let's say.\"\r\nPrincess prides itself on crafting every single part of its luxurious yachts in-house, at its Plymouth shipyards.\r\nWhat might prove a challenge to the yacht maker would be a clean break, or so-called \"Hard Brexit\", from the 28 bloc EU.\r\n\"That would be very bad news,\" admits Sheriff. \r\n\"We are very much a global company, we sell our boats literally all over the world, we source components from all over the world and natural blockages which would see components held up in customs with tariffs really is not in the interests of competition.\r\n\"And it's not in the interest of running a high-quality business and it's certainly not in the interest of maintaining high employment in the UK.\"\r\n\"Uncertainty is bad for business generally and consumer confidence,\" says Howard Pridding from British Marine.\r\n\"But we are strong at the moment, we are optimistic and we will continue to do the business while politicians talk about Brexit.\"\r\nPoole-based Sunseeker Yachts is also exhibiting in Monaco, showcasing a total of three yachts, including this 35-metre 116. \r\n\"Buying a luxury yacht is a 100 percent discretionary purchase,\" says Sunseeker CEO Phil Popham. \r\n\"No one needs yachts, it's about their leisure life, it's about their private life and although the weakness of the pound has in the short term made us more competitive against some of our foreign based manufacturers, foreign based competitors, it's not an impulse purchase and so I don' think the impact of the weak pound is going to be beneficial for a long period of time.\"\r\nLast week, British Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain was prepared to abide by European Union rules and pay in to the bloc's coffers for two years after leaving the EU in March 2019.\r\n\"What we really do want is a level of certainty and stability,\" he says. \r\nThe annual Monaco Yacht Show runs 27-30 September.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/7be346437fa2e45f7d2436806e742105 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

These are from 3,500 BC. Tel Es-Sakan site is one of the most important in Palestine, 3500 years old, which means 1,000 before the pyramids. We also have discovered camel bones here,\" he says.\r\nAl-A'utul shows salvaged fragments that he used to reassemble two thirds of a jar. He's also found a flint knife blade and camel bones.\r\nHamas is flattening the hill on the southern tip of Gaza City to make way for military bases and construction projects. \r\nAl-A'utul fears that the ancient ruins will be completely destroyed if nothing is done to preserve them.\r\n\"If this way of bulldozing, trucks and playing in the place continues, this place will be gone, erased...it will disappear,\" says al A'utul.\r\nThe site was accidentally discovered in 1990s when an expedition by French archaeologist Jean-Baptiste Humbert found the fortified settlement hidden in the the 10-hectare (25-acre) hill.\r\nThe settlement predates pharaonic rule on Egypt by centuries and the pyramids by a 1000 years.\r\nIn 2002, the French excavations stopped because of a Palestinian uprising in which protesters violently clashed with Israeli military posts.\r\nGaza is home to numerous ancient treasures. But, beyond the hot weather and urban sprawl, Gaza's unique political landscape has long complicated archaeological work.\r\nWith little open space in Gaza, a fast-growing population and an economy stifled by Israeli and Egyptian blockades, Hamas officials say they have no choice but to develop the area, making archaeology a low priority. \r\nDozens of ancient sites have been found in Gaza and excavations have revealed temples, monasteries, palaces, churches and mosques and mosaics from the Bronze Age and through the Byzantine, Greek, Roman and Islamic eras.\r\nBut most of these sites have disappeared. UNESCO is struggling to preserve some of remaining ones. \r\n \"I believe that what is going on and what happened in Tel Es-Sakan, which is also an important archaeological site is disastrous for the archaeology and cultural heritage in Palestine as it's also for its identity, identity of its people. So, it's of course an important concern for UNESCO and we already conveyed this concern to the relevant authorities,\" says  Junaid Sorosh-Wali, a UNESCO official in Palestinian Territories.\r\nIn 2009 and 2012, the expansion of universities destroyed the western and northern facades of Tel El-Sakan. \r\nPeople displaced during three wars between Hamas and Israel set up temporary dwellings on the eastern side. \r\nThe southern front remained, but Hamas authorities decided to flatten it. \r\nThe bulldozer work started in early August. \r\nHumbert, with the help of colleagues from Gaza's Islamic University, succeeded in stopping the work for two weeks while the\r\nministry and Hamas' Land Authority tried to settle the dispute syrrounding the ruins. \r\nJamal Abu Rida, the ministry's director of antiquities, says Tel Es-Sakan is a protected archaeological site under the auspices of his ministry, but that couldn't stop the more powerful Land Authority from destroying the final 1.2 hectares (three acres) of the site. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/2de7afb04b4013aa2bfa0d06ca72c33d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
