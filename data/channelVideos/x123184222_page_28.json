Angus King of Maine asked Mattis during a congressional hearing if he thinks it's in the national security interests of the United States to stay a part of the international accord.\r\nMattis said, \"Yes, senator, I do.\" \r\nPressed by Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota to explain, Mattis said the U.S. needs to confirm Iran is complying with the agreement and it's not outside of the president's \"portfolio'' to consider things beyond the letter of the agreement. \r\nPresident Donald Trump has called the deal the worst agreement ever negotiated by the United States.\r\nTrump has repeatedly said that he's inclined not to certify Iranian compliance after having twice found the country compliant at earlier deadlines. Denying certification could lead the U.S. to reintroduce sanctions, which in turn could lead Iran to walk away from the deal or restart previously curtailed nuclear activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/01a1a0c9a94a790ce9acefbed971c2bb \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(3 Oct 2017) Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Tuesday the United States should remain in the nuclear deal negotiated during the Obama administration that constrains Iran's ability to build a nuclear arsenal.\r\nSen. Angus King of Maine asked Mattis during a congressional hearing if he thinks it's in the national security interests of the United States to stay a part of the international accord.\r\nMattis said, \"Yes, senator, I do.\" \r\nPressed by Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota to explain, Mattis said the U.S. needs to confirm Iran is complying with the agreement and it's not outside of the president's \"portfolio'' to consider things beyond the letter of the agreement. \r\nPresident Donald Trump has called the deal the worst agreement ever negotiated by the United States.\r\nTrump has repeatedly said that he's inclined not to certify Iranian compliance after having twice found the country compliant at earlier deadlines. Denying certification could lead the U.S. to reintroduce sanctions, which in turn could lead Iran to walk away from the deal or restart previously curtailed nuclear activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/01a1a0c9a94a790ce9acefbed971c2bb \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
