                "description": "(29 Sep 2017) RESTRICTION SUMMARY: \r\nSTORYLINE: \r\nBenjamin Aidoo empez\u00f3 a transportar ata\u00fades para pagarse la escuela. Ahora, diez a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, lo que empez\u00f3 como un experimento se ha convertido en una empresa de unos cien empleados: acompa\u00f1an a los muertos a la tumba, pero con m\u00fasica y bailes. \r\nSu estilo es cada vez m\u00e1s copiado en Ghana.\r\nNAT \u2013 Benjamin Aidoo, jefe de la empresa Otafrija\r\n\"Nosotros siempre mejoramos nuestras coreograf\u00edas, traemos nuevos estilos para adaptarnos a los clientes para que sepan que somos \u00fanicos\", dice... \"el cielo es mi l\u00edmite, pero tengo que ir m\u00e1s all\u00e1\", es su lema.\r\n(LOCATION: Accra, Ghana)\r\nCon este tipo de celebraciones, la gente ha empezado a ver los funerales como una ocasi\u00f3n para reunirse con la familia y celebrar al muerto, m\u00e1s que llorar por \u00e9l.\r\n(LOCATION: Prampram, Ghana)\r\nAl principio, estos enterradores vest\u00edan de negro, como lo han hecho tradicionalmente en su pa\u00eds y en gran parte del mundo. Pero con el tiempo, Aidoo empez\u00f3 a incluir colores en su propia vestimenta y a comprar sus propios trajes y zapatos.\r\nAhora, atiende media docena de entierros a la semana. Los costos dependen del n\u00famero de empleados que necesite y de los trajes que usan, pero oscilan entre los 180 y los 270 d\u00f3lares.\r\nNAT \u2013 Anabelle Namartey, nieta de un fallecido\r\n\"Este es el m\u00e1ximo tributo que podemos pagar por enterrar a alguien\", dice esta mujer, que cree que deber\u00eda ser m\u00e1s habitual despedir a los muertos con una celebraci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de todo el tiempo que han pasado en la tierra.\r\nPero no todos est\u00e1n de acuerdo con romper la solemnidad.\r\nNAT \u2013 Gabriel Maurice Martey, sobrino de un fallecido\r\nEste hombre opina que este tipo de ceremonia no tiene nada que ver con las tradiciones de su pa\u00eds, ni en t\u00e9rminos religiosos ni hist\u00f3ricos.\r\nPero a Benjamin Aidoo no le afectan las cr\u00edticas, \u00e9l se limita a intentar hacer de un momento amargo, uno un poco m\u00e1s feliz.\r\nAlba Tobella, Associated Press\r\n=== SOURCE: AP===\r\n===========================================================\r\nClients are reminded: \r\n(i) to check the terms of their licence agreements for use of content outside news programming and that further advice and assistance can be obtained from the AP Archive on: Tel +44 (0) 20 7482 7482 Email: info@aparchive.com\r\n(ii) they should check with the applicable collecting society in their Territory regarding the clearance of any sound recording or performance included within the AP Television News service \r\n(iii) they have editorial responsibility for the use of all and any content included within the AP Television News service and for libel, privacy, compliance and third party rights applicable to their Territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/eb689669a03aa7aba2aa02dd3548fa99 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
