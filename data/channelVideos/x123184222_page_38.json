                "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Brazil's embattled President Michel Temer said on Wednesday that the decision taken by the lower house to not suspend him over bribery charges was \"a conquest for the democratic state of the law, the strength of the institutions and the constitution,\" instead of a personal victory. \r\nTemer, who survived the key congressional vote on Wednesday, mustered enough support to stay in office and avoid being tried by the country's highest court.\r\nHe spoke briefly to the journalists from the presidential palace, immediately after the last lawmaker voted calling on Brazilians to stay united. \r\nWhile Temer was clearly victorious, he won't likely have much time to celebrate. \r\nAttorney General Rodrigo Janot, who levelled the bribery charge against Temer, is expected to charge him with obstruction of justice by the end of the month. \r\nThat would provoke a second vote, forcing his allies to once again decide whether to risk their own political futures by sticking with the deeply unpopular leader. \r\nAll 513 seats in the chamber are up for election next year.\r\nTemer needed the support of just one-third of the 513 members of the lower Chamber of Deputies, or 171 members. \r\nHours after the voting began, he had received the votes of more than that number of legislators. \r\nIn the end, 263 deputies voted for the president and 227 voted against him. The remaining were abstentions and absences.\r\nThe latest national poll said just 5 percent of Brazilians approve Temer, while he has been providing financial backing to various projects to gain support from legislators.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8420402fd367c5e40af272e4549ab341 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Paying outstanding debts for her father and uncle, finding work for the youngest men. And the biggest bonus: A chance to live in an Islamic society that was apparently on the ascendant.\r\nIt didn't take long before their dreams were crushed and their hopes for a better life destroyed as each of those promised benefits failed to materialize. Instead, the family was faced with a society where single women were expected to be married off to IS fighters, and a raging battle in which all able-bodied men were compelled to report to the frontline.\r\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Nurshardrina Khairadhania, now 19, recalled her family's fateful decision to immigrate to the IS stronghold of Raqqa two years ago _ and how, only months later, their bid to escape began.\r\nDuring that time the family endured separation, her grandmother died after the arduous journey and an uncle was killed in an airstrike.\r\nShe now lives with her mother, two sisters, an aunt, three female cousins and their three young daughters in Ain Issa, a camp for the displaced run by the Kurdish forces fighting to expel IS from Raqqa. Her father and four surviving male cousins are in detention north of there. While the men are being interrogated by the Kurdish forces for possible links to IS, the women wait in a tent in the searing heat, hoping for the family to be reunited and return to their home in Jakarta.\r\nNur's family is among thousands from Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and the Middle East who chased the dream of a new Islamic society advertised by IS in slickly produced propaganda videos, online blogs and other social media.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/18b5029243e3fb3ebfd928661b7cf785 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

They must find a way for dispensary owners to access banks.\r\n\"It is not normal for people to walk around with million of dollars in cash so we've got to deal with this reality and figure out a way to address that concern,\" said Los Angeles City Council President Herb Wesson.\r\nMany banks just don't want the risk of doing business with companies whose product remains illegal under federal law.\r\n\"They could technically be seen as aiding and abetting the commission of the federal crime of trafficking cannabis. It could be accessory after the fact,\" said Nicole Howell Neubert, a marijuana industry attorney.\r\nKiloh and other dispensary owners have just had to become their own banks, storing away hundreds of thousands of dollars in safes and vaults. \r\nMore than 50 security cameras scan his offices and hallways, keeping watch outside the building, as well. An armed guard stands inside.\r\nThe on-hand cash is just a daily hassle, and the trek each month to pay taxes is dangerous, with a sense of relief when he finally hands it off to city officials.\r\n\"You can just feel the tension relieved when you don't have to have that responsibility of all that on you,\" Kiloh said after dropping off his taxes at City Hall recently. \"And to have a receipt for it feel really good.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/085939fa6199fea3d0de5c4f92a9e3c6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Honestly, I don't think there is any way to prepare for it,\" Akira Fukatsu, a 65-year-old retiree, said as he sat drinking a beer on a bench in a park overlooking a US Navy base in Yokosuka, south of Tokyo. \r\nMany Japanese, South Koreans and Chinese appear to share that sense of resignation over North Korea's apparent newfound capacity to launch missiles capable of reaching much of the continental United States.\r\nThe 4 July firing of a Hwasong-14 ICBM, its first test, and another last weekend suggest that major US cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago are within range of North Korean weapons. \r\nSuch missiles could be armed with nuclear, biological or chemical warheads, although experts say North Korea hasn't mastered miniaturising them and might not have the technology to ensure a warhead would survive re-entry into the atmosphere from space or even hit an intended target.\r\nAttitudes in Japan, South Korea and China toward the threat vary, but likely reflect a sangfroid partly born of living with the legacy of the Cold War and ever present risks of huge earthquakes and other natural disasters.\r\n___\r\nJAPAN\r\nMany Japanese have mixed feelings about the latest developments, viewing them as a sign that by focusing on ICBM development, North Korea's aggression is directed toward the US rather than Japan, even if test launches have been splashing down off Japan's coast.\r\n\"Japan was within range of North Korean missiles even before their range extended recently,\" said Tetsuharu Nagashima, an official in charge of emergency response in Yokosuka, which is home to some of the 50,000 American troops stationed in US ally Japan, as well as a Japanese naval base.\r\nInstructions on the local government website tell people to take refuge in strong buildings or underground shopping arcades in case of attack, and to hit the ground and cover their heads if no such shelter is nearby.\r\nUnlike some communities that have held drills and drawn up contingency plans, Nagashima said Yokosuka had no plan to conduct evacuation drills.\r\nMisaki Honna, the mother of a 10-month-old girl, said suggestions that Yokosuka might be targeted because of the US and Japanese military presence were troubling.\r\n\"But even if we flee, we wouldn't know where to go. If a missile strikes, there's almost nothing you can do about it,\" she said.\r\nEiko Miyauchi, 83, endured US fire-bombings during World War II. As a child, she was evacuated from the coast and took shelter in an underground bunker as bombs rained down.\r\n\"I lived through the war, and I can't imagine anything being as scary as that one,\" she said.\r\n___\r\nSOUTH KOREA\r\nLiving just across the Demilitarized Zone from North Korea, South Koreans are famously laid back about its displays of military might.\r\nBut while life continues as usual and there's no visible panic on the streets, at least some South Koreans are starting to question whether North Korea's nuclear weapons and missiles may have become bigger problems than anyone wants to admit.\r\n\"South Koreans have been too relaxed,\" said Yang Seung-jun, noting that missile launches show North Korea could attack the South at any time. \"It's our choice to laugh it off and say 'North Korea can't do that,' or the 'United Nations will sanction them'... But war never happens when we expect it to,\" he said.\r\nStill, she does worry about the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3990ff84f9f7adabf957148be02b7010 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
