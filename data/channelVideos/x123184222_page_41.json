            "description": "(4 Aug 2017) Special Counsel Robert Mueller is using a grand jury in Washington as part of an investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, a person familiar with the probe said Thursday.\r\nThe use of a grand jury, a standard prosecution tool in criminal investigations, suggests that Mueller and his team of investigators are likely to hear from witnesses and demand documents in the coming weeks and months. The person who confirmed to The Associated Press that Mueller had turned to a grand jury was not authorized to discuss the investigation by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.\r\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the use of a grand jury.\r\nGrand juries are common vehicles to subpoena witnesses and records and to present evidence, though they do not suggest any criminal charges are near or will necessarily be sought. It was not immediately clear how or whether the Washington grand jury was connected to the work of a separate one in Alexandria, Virginia. That panel has been used to gather information on Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser.\r\nA spokesman for Mueller's team did not return an email seeking comment.\r\nMueller's reliance on a grand jury is the \"logical next step in this investigation\" given that it's the traditional method for prosecutors to gather evidence, said Washington defense lawyer Jacob Frenkel.\r\nMeanwhile, lawyers for President Donald Trump said they were unaware of the existence of a grand jury and had no information to suggest the president himself was under federal investigation.\r\n\"With respect to the news of the federal grand jury, I have no reason to believe that the president is under investigation,\" defense attorney John Dowd told the AP.\r\nTy Cobb, special counsel to the president, said he wasn't aware Mueller had started using a new grand jury.\r\n\"Grand jury matters are typically secret,\" Cobb said. \"The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly. ... The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.\"\r\nIt was not clear what witnesses might appear before the grand jury or what evidence it might be accumulating or presented with.\r\nMueller was appointed special counsel in May by the Justice Department following the firing by Trump of FBI Director James Comey. He has since assembled a team of more than a dozen investigators, including current and former Justice Department prosecutors with experience in international bribery, organized crime and financial fraud.\r\nThat team has been working at an undisclosed location in Washington, so presenting evidence inside a federal courthouse in the city could be more convenient for the group of investigators than working out of Alexandria. Mueller also worked as a prosecutor in Washington before becoming FBI director, a job he held for 12 years.\r\nA grand jury \"increases the power of the prosecutors,\" said David Levine, law professor at the University of California Hastings College of Law. \"Instead of asking for people to provide testimony, they can demand testimony under the penalty of perjury and under risk of contempt of court. And with respect to documents, instead of asking people for documents, they can demand documents. And so for example the tax returns, a subpoena can unlock those tax returns,\" he said.  \r\nNews of the grand jury came as senators introduced two bipartisan bills aimed at protecting Mueller from being fired by Trump, with both parties signaling resistance to any White House effort to derail the investigation into Russian meddling in last year's election.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/00cb8ccdae6ad860b91259c9d919db02 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(4 Aug 2017) Special Counsel Robert Mueller is using a grand jury in Washington as part of an investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, a person familiar with the probe said Thursday.\r\nThe use of a grand jury, a standard prosecution tool in criminal investigations, suggests that Mueller and his team of investigators are likely to hear from witnesses and demand documents in the coming weeks and months. The person who confirmed to The Associated Press that Mueller had turned to a grand jury was not authorized to discuss the investigation by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.\r\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the use of a grand jury.\r\nGrand juries are common vehicles to subpoena witnesses and records and to present evidence, though they do not suggest any criminal charges are near or will necessarily be sought. It was not immediately clear how or whether the Washington grand jury was connected to the work of a separate one in Alexandria, Virginia. That panel has been used to gather information on Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser.\r\nA spokesman for Mueller's team did not return an email seeking comment.\r\nMueller's reliance on a grand jury is the \"logical next step in this investigation\" given that it's the traditional method for prosecutors to gather evidence, said Washington defense lawyer Jacob Frenkel.\r\nMeanwhile, lawyers for President Donald Trump said they were unaware of the existence of a grand jury and had no information to suggest the president himself was under federal investigation.\r\n\"With respect to the news of the federal grand jury, I have no reason to believe that the president is under investigation,\" defense attorney John Dowd told the AP.\r\nTy Cobb, special counsel to the president, said he wasn't aware Mueller had started using a new grand jury.\r\n\"Grand jury matters are typically secret,\" Cobb said. \"The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly. ... The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.\"\r\nIt was not clear what witnesses might appear before the grand jury or what evidence it might be accumulating or presented with.\r\nMueller was appointed special counsel in May by the Justice Department following the firing by Trump of FBI Director James Comey. He has since assembled a team of more than a dozen investigators, including current and former Justice Department prosecutors with experience in international bribery, organized crime and financial fraud.\r\nThat team has been working at an undisclosed location in Washington, so presenting evidence inside a federal courthouse in the city could be more convenient for the group of investigators than working out of Alexandria. Mueller also worked as a prosecutor in Washington before becoming FBI director, a job he held for 12 years.\r\nA grand jury \"increases the power of the prosecutors,\" said David Levine, law professor at the University of California Hastings College of Law. \"Instead of asking for people to provide testimony, they can demand testimony under the penalty of perjury and under risk of contempt of court. And with respect to documents, instead of asking people for documents, they can demand documents. And so for example the tax returns, a subpoena can unlock those tax returns,\" he said.  \r\nNews of the grand jury came as senators introduced two bipartisan bills aimed at protecting Mueller from being fired by Trump, with both parties signaling resistance to any White House effort to derail the investigation into Russian meddling in last year's election.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3b404f0adeef7cb8dd1b477793dee9fe \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
