            "description": "(4 Aug 2017) JASON ALDEAN CELEBRATES TRIPLE HIT SINGLES, GETS READY FOR BABY BOY\r\nCountry star Jason Aldean is having a big year.\r\nThree singles from his 2016 album, \"They Don't Know\" \u2013 \"Lights Come On,\" \"A Little More Summertime\" and \"Any Ol' Barstool\" \u2013 have shot to number 1 on the U.S. Country Airplay Chart.\r\nAnd if that wasn't enough, Aldean and his wife Brittany Kerr are expecting their first child together \u2013 a baby boy.\r\nIn Nashville Wednesday (2 AUG. 2017), Aldean celebrated the success of the three singles along with their songwriters, including duo Florida Georgia Line, in front of a crowd of fans.\r\nBut Aldean is already hard at work finishing his next album. \r\n\"We're actually in the studio,\" Aldean said. \"We're actually going in next week and try to finish the album. We've got a new album that should be done by the end of the year. Won't be out I'm sure by the end of the year, but maybe have a single off of it by the end of the year. So I don't know. If we can squeeze four No. 1s out of this record, that's a pretty good run for an album. And we've got some really cool stuff I am working on for the next album that I am excited for people to hear.\"\r\nAldean will be out on tour until the fall when he takes time off to spend the holidays with his family. Aldean has two daughters from a previous marriage, but this will be his first son.\r\n\"Means I am going to be home and have a little time at home to kind of hang out with him for a little while before we get back on the road,\" Aldean said. \"It's going to be a fun year, fun Christmas. Fun around the holidays this year.\"\r\nHe also revealed that although they came up with a lot of potential names, there was only one he and his wife both liked. \r\n\"We've pretty much decided,\" Aldean said. \"I mean, it's not hard when you throw out a ton of names and there's only one that you and your wife agree on so. I would throw out stuff and she's like, 'Yeah, I don't like that.' And she would throw out something, and I would say, 'yeah, I don't really like that.' THere's only one where we were like, 'That's pretty cool.' So we've kind pretty much decided at this point.

                "description": "(4 Aug 2017) JASON ALDEAN CELEBRATES TRIPLE HIT SINGLES, GETS READY FOR BABY BOY\r\nCountry star Jason Aldean is having a big year.\r\nThree singles from his 2016 album, \"They Don't Know\" \u2013 \"Lights Come On,\" \"A Little More Summertime\" and \"Any Ol' Barstool\" \u2013 have shot to number 1 on the U.S. Country Airplay Chart.\r\nAnd if that wasn't enough, Aldean and his wife Brittany Kerr are expecting their first child together \u2013 a baby boy.\r\nIn Nashville Wednesday (2 AUG. 2017), Aldean celebrated the success of the three singles along with their songwriters, including duo Florida Georgia Line, in front of a crowd of fans.\r\nBut Aldean is already hard at work finishing his next album. \r\n\"We're actually in the studio,\" Aldean said. \"We're actually going in next week and try to finish the album. We've got a new album that should be done by the end of the year. Won't be out I'm sure by the end of the year, but maybe have a single off of it by the end of the year. So I don't know. If we can squeeze four No. 1s out of this record, that's a pretty good run for an album. And we've got some really cool stuff I am working on for the next album that I am excited for people to hear.\"\r\nAldean will be out on tour until the fall when he takes time off to spend the holidays with his family. Aldean has two daughters from a previous marriage, but this will be his first son.\r\n\"Means I am going to be home and have a little time at home to kind of hang out with him for a little while before we get back on the road,\" Aldean said. \"It's going to be a fun year, fun Christmas. Fun around the holidays this year.\"\r\nHe also revealed that although they came up with a lot of potential names, there was only one he and his wife both liked. \r\n\"We've pretty much decided,\" Aldean said. \"I mean, it's not hard when you throw out a ton of names and there's only one that you and your wife agree on so. I would throw out stuff and she's like, 'Yeah, I don't like that.' And she would throw out something, and I would say, 'yeah, I don't really like that.' THere's only one where we were like, 'That's pretty cool.' So we've kind pretty much decided at this point.

A few people were treated for smoke inhalation, according to Dubai's Gulf News website.\r\nSeveral residents said the fire broke out just after 1 a.m. at the 86-story Torch Tower \u2014 a more than 1,100-foot-tall (335 meters) residential building in Dubai's popular waterfront Marina district. The same building had also caught fire just two-and-a-half years earlier.\r\nThe cause of the fire was not immediately known but in the past, such infernos in Dubai have been linked to highly flammable building cladding \u2014 as was the devastating Grenfell tower fire in London in June that killed at least 80 people.\r\nMore than 40 floors of the building on one side were engulfed in flames as residents looked on from below, many in tears. The firefighters battled the blaze for more than two hours.\r\nThe Torch Tower caught fire in February 2015; there were also no casualties reported in that blaze.
