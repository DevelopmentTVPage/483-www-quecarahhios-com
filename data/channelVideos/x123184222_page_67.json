It killed seven children, including all five of Buthaina'a brothers and sisters.\r\nEight other children were wounded, including two-year old Sam Bassem Al-Hamdani, whose parents were killed in the attack.\r\nAmnesty's report outlines how the evidence was collected:\r\n\"After examining photographic evidence provided by a local journalist who dug out the remaining fragments of the weapon at the site, Amnesty International's arms expert was able to positively identify the data plate from a US-made MAU-169L\/B computer control group.

                "description": "(26 Sep 2017) LEADIN:\r\nAmnesty International has claimed that the Saudi-led coalition forces used a US-made bomb in one of its airstrikes in Yemen last month.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nThe bomb that destroyed this residential building in the Yemeni capital last month killing 16 civilians and wounding 17 others, was a US-made bomb, Amnesty International have said.\r\nThe statement, published by the organisation on its website on Friday, quoted one of its weapons experts who analysed the remains of the bomb and found that they bore clear marks similar to US-made components commonly used in laser-guided bombs delivered from the air.\r\nThe injured include a five-year-old girl - Buthaina Al-Rimi, whose picture was widely publicised following the strike.\r\nAdel Al-Hadad, a human rights activist and lawyer, stresses that the bomb was American-made and that evidence to support his comes from the remains of the bomb.\r\nThe airstrike, which took place on 25 August, hit a group of houses in Sanaa, causing severe damage to three of them. It killed seven children, including all five of Buthaina'a brothers and sisters.\r\nEight other children were wounded, including two-year old Sam Bassem Al-Hamdani, whose parents were killed in the attack.\r\nAmnesty's report outlines how the evidence was collected:\r\n\"After examining photographic evidence provided by a local journalist who dug out the remaining fragments of the weapon at the site, Amnesty International's arms expert was able to positively identify the data plate from a US-made MAU-169L\/B computer control group. It is a part used in several types of laser-guided air-dropped bombs.\"\r\nAl-Haddad is appreciative of what he perceives to be the pressure exerted upon government by the US citizens. \r\n\"American people and American organisations should be thanked for the pressure they've placed every day and every hour on the US and the Senate and Congress, it proves the point is valid,\" he says.\r\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia has threatened other countries over a proposed resolution at the UN's leading human rights body that would send international, independent investigators into Yemen.\r\nA Saudi letter obtained by The Associated Press shows the kingdom has warned that adoption of the proposal by Canada and the Netherlands at the Human Rights Council could \"negatively affect\" their trade and diplomatic ties with the rich, influential kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/789f30111fdd19e829cfa47e1e72315c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
