            "description": "(28 Sep 2017) A few tiny herds of African antelope have a new home on ranges in New Orleans, and zookeepers hope they will take advantage of the extra space away from curious crowds of humans to relax and reproduce.\r\nThe Alliance for Sustainable Wildlife breeding center has developed 88 acres (35 hectares) of its 1,000-acre (400-hectare) parcel of land, on the other side of the Mississippi River from the much smaller Audubon Zoo, where about 2,000 animals are on display.\r\nIn addition to 22 antelope - eight elands, six sable antelope, six Eastern bongos and two yellow-backed duiker (pronounced DIKE-er) - the area also will serve as home for seven giraffes and two okapi, a close relation to the giraffe that stands out from the rest because of its black-and-white-striped legs. Most of the animals have been moved here from the San Diego Zoo and its safari park.\r\n\"We're letting them be animals, letting them do their thing,\" said Michelle Hatwood, curator for the center, which was jointly established by the Audubon Nature Institute, an umbrella organization that includes the Audubon Zoo, and the San Diego Zoo Global Wildlife Conservancy.\r\nThe land, owned by The Audubon Institute and the Coast Guard, was used for 20 years by an Audubon project that focused on cloning and artificial insemination of endangered animals. The San Diego Zoo covered the $5.2 million cost for new site work, including the paddocks with solar-powered double gates, zoo spokesman Frank Donze said. The two zoos are sharing a little more than $1 million a year in operating costs, Hatwood said.\r\nOfficials from both zoos planned a news conference Thursday, about 4\u00bd years after announcing the project, to celebrate its official opening.\r\nIn the new facility, six Eastern bongo, nearly chest-high to Hatwood, and a pair of yellow-backed duiker about half their size share 3 acres (1 hectare).\r\nThe bongo are from what Hatwood described as a critically endangered subspecies with fewer than 100 in the wild, though North American zoos hold about 550.\r\n\"Bongo are water-loving forest antelope, so this is their dream,\" Hatwood said Tuesday, as she and zoo curator Joel Hamilton took journalists on a preview tour through the paddocks on a low flatbed trailer with hay bale seats.\r\nThe duiker were delighted with their new environment, she said: \"They immediately started to breed. They were excited by all the space.\"\r\nThe bongo and duiker will move into a 12-acre (5-hectare) enclosure when its current occupants - eight eland and six sable antelope - move into a 45-acre (18-hectare) enclosure with the seven giraffes, including two who arrived pregnant.\r\n\"The exciting thing about the whole project is that in these large spaces, we're really able to increase the population sizes so they're much more sustainable for the future,\" Robert \"Bob\" Wiese, chief life sciences officer at San Diego Global, said in a phone interview Tuesday.\r\nWhile most of the animals have explored all their new territory, the giraffe - sentinels of the savannah and browsers along the forest's edge - are cautious beasts and have stayed at the perimeter near their barn, Hatwood said. \"They're the drama queens,\" she said.\r\nGiraffe aren't currently considered threatened or endangered, but that's likely to change after scientists fully study recent genetic and population work, Hatwood said.\r\nThe eland aren't endangered either, but are great for teaching people about relationships between people and wild animals, Hatwood said. They're the world's largest antelope - weighing up to 1 ton (1,000 kilograms) each - and are often poached. But they're also being studied for farming because they're easier on the environment than cattle and are calmer than most antelope, she said.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/558b301c50334204b215648761157f5b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

I hoped that we could make our country better through doing the protest. No, I didn't think that we would get this kind of remark from the president,\" Reid said. \r\nHe cited statistics from Harvard Ph.D. candidate Clint Smith and talked about how many New Deal policies in the 1930s excluded many minorities and have helped create issues of inequality that remain today. \r\nHe also talked about an op-ed piece he wrote for The New York Times this week explaining the protests.\r\nThe 49ers held meetings Monday to discuss how they will handle protests and the national anthem on Sunday in Arizona. \r\nThere was a team-wide meeting and the leadership council of about a dozen players met with coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch.\r\nThey are still deciding what they will do but Reid said he didn't want to force anyone to do something they weren't comfortable doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/dc80e7f8827cc488ff8e4d5490564a2c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

American photojournalist Wesley Bocxe and his wife Elizabeth made it to the roof of his ten-story apartment building when the quake started; his wife was killed when the floors underneath pancaked underneath them, but Bocxe somehow survived the plunge, though he was seriously injured.\r\nLocal media quoted one woman who said that she and two relatives took refuge in the bathroom of their upper floor apartment, and the room _ apparently constructed more sturdily than the rest of the building _ plunged intact to near street level, and they were able to escape with the help of neighbors.\r\nFor a family of four from the Iztapalapa neighborhood on the city's gritty east side, the quake was so nightmarish that the family's father briefly lost it.\r\nThe family asked not to be identified by name for privacy reasons.\r\nThey rushed out of their home with their nine-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son when the quake started, only to have a six-foot (two meter) perimeter wall fall on the children. The girl's pelvis was crushed, her liver damaged and she had internal bleeding. The son had an exposed fracture of his leg, with the bone poking though and blood spurting out.\r\nThe mother helped her son, who was crawling, to get to the street, and she walked into traffic to stop a car.\r\nOnce they got to the hospital, policemen station outside saw the girl's condition and quickly offered to summon a helicopter, which ferried both children to the Magdalena de la Salinas hospital.\r\nThe girl is wrapped in sheets on her hospital bed, her father holding her hand.

Every actor at that time had his own car and used it in his movies. I was the first person who suggested collecting these cars and allowing rentals to film and drama shoots,\" he says. \r\n\"I had little work to do.
