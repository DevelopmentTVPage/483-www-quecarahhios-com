            "description": "(1 Aug 2017) LEADIN:\r\nWeary Spaniards in Madrid now have a place to go for an afternoon siesta - a dedicated nap bar has opened in the capital.  \r\nSiesta &amp; Go caters to people who work far from home and need a space to rest and relax during the busy working day. \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nAs the hot afternoon sun bears down, there's nothing more Spanish than an afternoon siesta. \r\nWhile smaller towns tend to shut down for a few hours in the afternoon, in the cities it's harder for people to find somewhere to lay their head. \r\nBut for those seeking solace from the sweltering summer temperatures, there's now a dedicated place for an afternoon nap in the heart of Madrid. \r\nSiesta &amp; Go opened in May, giving customers a quiet, cool space between 11am and 7pm every day. \r\nPeople can choose from either a bunk bed, private room or an armchair to relax. \r\nThere are 19 beds available and people can pay by the minute or by the hour. It costs eight euros an hour in a bunk bed and up to 14 euros for 60 minutes in a private room.\r\n iPads, newspapers, magazines or books are also provided on demand and and each client is given a fresh set of sheets and blankets.\r\nGraphic designer Philip Marco uses the service several times a week. \r\n\"I have always come a long way from home to my workplace. So everyday I feel tired, so siesta is a special way for me to get some energy back,\" he says.\r\nHe adds that a short nap keeps him refreshed for the long hours he works: \"I come for about 30 minutes, something like that. Sleep 30 minutes and that usually is enough for me to be able to get through the evening.\"\r\nDespite Spain's well-known tradition of taking a siesta, the business idea came about after the owner visited Japan.\r\n\"My boss went on a trip to Tokyo and realised that a siesta (bar) is a normal thing there. And so she wanted to implement it in Spain. And, well, what is more Spanish than the siesta,\" says Siesta &amp; Go manager, Johan Grillo.\r\nJapan is known for its capsule hotels and has many nap cafes. Many there believe getting short amounts of rest can make people better equipped for the rest of the working day.\r\nGrillo says many Spanish professionals are also waking up to the benefits. And he says he hasn't had any problem with customers overstaying their welcome.\r\n\"There are clients that say to me, 'Look, Johan, I need you to wake me in 30 minutes, 40 minutes, one hour, and I go and wake them. I always ask the customer, 'Do you need me to wake you?' If they say yes, I will go and wake them when they want. And if they say no, it's up to them.\"\r\nSiesta &amp; Go is located in the Azca neighbourhood, near the Nuevos Ministerios metro stop. It's surrounded by the offices of financial firms and large businesses, like Google, Deloitte and HSBC. \r\nCity worker Alvaro Huerta says he sees some benefit of having a siesta service. \r\n\"Here in Spain, I believe a high number of people take a siesta in the middle of the day. It's true that maybe in big cities people have less and less time or it takes a long time for them to travel home to take a siesta.\"\r\nJournalist, Ramon Bilbao isn't convinced it will be a popular option: \"In summer I'm not sure, because people work until three in the afternoon and then eat at home and take a siesta at home. In the rest of the year maybe.\"\r\n\"It's a Spanish tradition but I think that it's more of a legend than a tradition. Because, with the lifestyle we have, the working hours, the rhythm of life of that all Spanish workers ultimately have, you have very little free time for a siesta, in my case, at least during the week,\" adds finance worker Carlos Villarroja. \r\nIf you get tired during the working day, many doctors say taking a short rest can be beneficial. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/efa6ec5a983a45fe5c6a0974a7f719d2 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Hunt, whose debut album \"Montevallo\" came out in 2014, wrote the song with Zach Crowell, Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne.\r\nThe inspiration for the snappy and infectiously melodic song came from Hunt's wife, Hannah, McAnally said.\r\n\"It was a playful ode to her,\" McAnally said. \"He had written a lot of serious stuff about the tumultuous part of their relationship and I think he just wanted to say that they were in a good place.\"\r\nFlorida Georgia Line's \"Cruise\" benefited from having a remix released with rapper Nelly that helped it further crossover to new audiences. But McAnally thinks \"Back Road\" has dominated this summer because Hunt has taken his time in releasing new music.\r\nIt's the stand-alone single for Hunt this year, with no announced date of when his sophomore album may drop.\r\n\"It raced up the charts so fast that had he put another song out, it may not have seen this growth,\" McAnally said.\r\nOther top singles in the history of the Hot Country Songs chart include \"Walk On By,\" a song by Leroy Van Dyke, which hit No. 1 in 1961 and stayed there for 19 weeks, according to Billboard. Florida Georgia Line scored another big hit with last year's \"H.O.L.Y.,\" which topped the chart for 18 weeks.\r\nMcAnally said he can pinpoint the moment he knew Hunt had the \"song of the summer.\"\r\n\"This summer a boat went by me many times playing 'Body Like a Back Road,' so I feel like that is the indicator,\" McAnally said.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/7c8a0a2f45fb1093db1006f3b964cb5a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

We will also be judged by how well we prepare our cats for the show,\" says Ali.\r\nDog competitions are another favorite at the expo.\r\nAround 60 owners and their dogs are taking part in agility competitions and games to strengthen their bonds, including ball hunting, an eating contest and racing.\r\nThe show has attracted may exhibitors keen to expand into the Indonesian market. \r\nGerman pet-care retailer Happy Dog - Happy Cat has only had a presence in the country for 2 years, and currently provides its products to over 300 pet shops.  \r\nPresident and Director of Happy Dog - Happy Cat Indonesia, Marco Hutterer says direct interaction with customers is a key part of his marketing strategy.\r\n\"Pets today, in today's world, they are like family members.

                "description": "(31 Jul 2017) LEADIN:\r\nIndonesia's first international pet expo has featured everything from dogs and cats to exotic birds and sugar gliders. \r\nIt's a sign of the blossoming pet care industry in South East Asia , which is expected to reach 1.4 billion US Dollars by 2020.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nCat lovers gather around to see the judging of the best short and long-haired felines. \r\nTheir temperament, coat and health are all under consideration by the eight judges. \r\nThis is just one of the many exhibitions and shows featuring various popular pets. \r\nThe competition follows the judging guidelines set up by the Cat Fanciers' Association, the world's largest association of pedigreed cats based in the United States.\r\nIt measures 5 characteristics of each cat - its head, body, fur, fur colour and eye colour - to decide the winner.\r\nMuhammad Ali Suwed, a pet breeder with 25 year of experience from the city of Bogor, has entered several of his cats to the competition.\r\n\"This event can measure whether we have bred our cats up to the established standard. We will also be judged by how well we prepare our cats for the show,\" says Ali.\r\nDog competitions are another favorite at the expo.\r\nAround 60 owners and their dogs are taking part in agility competitions and games to strengthen their bonds, including ball hunting, an eating contest and racing.\r\nThe show has attracted may exhibitors keen to expand into the Indonesian market. \r\nGerman pet-care retailer Happy Dog - Happy Cat has only had a presence in the country for 2 years, and currently provides its products to over 300 pet shops.  \r\nPresident and Director of Happy Dog - Happy Cat Indonesia, Marco Hutterer says direct interaction with customers is a key part of his marketing strategy.\r\n\"Pets today, in today's world, they are like family members.

And I said 'What do I do? I'm coming to you, what do I do?' And she said 'I don't know what you should do,'\" Diana said. \"And that was it.

The tapes include her discussing Charles' relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles, whom Charles later married in 2005.\r\nThe recordings also show Diana talking about falling  \"deeply in love\" with a man widely believed to be her protection officer, Barry Mannakee, as well as Charles' attempts to woo her during a barbeque in 1979 when she was 18.\r\nPolice held some of the videotapes after they were seized in ex-royal butler Paul Burrell's home in 2001. Diana's family tried to make a legal claim to the recordings, but they were returned to Settelen in 2004.\r\nExcerpts of the recordings were aired in the U.S. in 2004 but they have never been screened in Britain. \r\nThe documentary airs 6 August 2017 on Channel 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/26257ebfa84a2646e5f6de03b8864e0d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

It costs eight euros an hour in a bunk bed and up to 14 euros for 60 minutes in a private room.\r\n iPads, newspapers, magazines or books are also provided on demand and and each client is given a fresh set of sheets and blankets.\r\nGraphic designer Philip Marco uses the service several times a week. \r\n\"I have always come a long way from home to my workplace. So everyday I feel tired, so siesta is a special way for me to get some energy back,\" he says.\r\nHe adds that a short nap keeps him refreshed for the long hours he works: \"I come for about 30 minutes, something like that.

And so she wanted to implement it in Spain. And, well, what is more Spanish than the siesta,\" says Siesta &amp; Go manager, Johan Grillo.\r\nJapan is known for its capsule hotels and has many nap cafes. Many there believe getting short amounts of rest can make people better equipped for the rest of the working day.\r\nGrillo says many Spanish professionals are also waking up to the benefits. And he says he hasn't had any problem with customers overstaying their welcome.\r\n\"There are clients that say to me, 'Look, Johan, I need you to wake me in 30 minutes, 40 minutes, one hour, and I go and wake them. I always ask the customer, 'Do you need me to wake you?' If they say yes, I will go and wake them when they want. And if they say no, it's up to them.\"\r\nSiesta &amp; Go is located in the Azca neighbourhood, near the Nuevos Ministerios metro stop. It's surrounded by the offices of financial firms and large businesses, like Google, Deloitte and HSBC. \r\nCity worker Alvaro Huerta says he sees some benefit of having a siesta service. \r\n\"Here in Spain, I believe a high number of people take a siesta in the middle of the day. It's true that maybe in big cities people have less and less time or it takes a long time for them to travel home to take a siesta.\"\r\nJournalist, Ramon Bilbao isn't convinced it will be a popular option: \"In summer I'm not sure, because people work until three in the afternoon and then eat at home and take a siesta at home. In the rest of the year maybe.\"\r\n\"It's a Spanish tradition but I think that it's more of a legend than a tradition. Because, with the lifestyle we have, the working hours, the rhythm of life of that all Spanish workers ultimately have, you have very little free time for a siesta, in my case, at least during the week,\" adds finance worker Carlos Villarroja. \r\nIf you get tired during the working day, many doctors say taking a short rest can be beneficial. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ab45ffe07ca1919c34e2a3c9d8e5244f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Now, art fans can step inside.\r\nLondon's Royal Academy of Arts is unveiling a new exhibit that shows Matisse in the studio.\r\nIt's claimed to be the first exhibit to explore how the artist's treasured collection of objects inspired his work and often became the subject matter.\r\nIt includes around 35 objects, accompanied by 65 Matisse artworks.\r\n\"We hope that walking through the exhibition you'll really get an intimate sense of the studio process,\" says curator Helen Burnham.\r\n\"Looking at the actual objects, how they appear in his work and on a more conceptual level how they affected his sense of composition, colour, design and the evolution of his art, towards the end of his life even.\"\r\nMatisse's eclectic collection ranges from Chinese porcelain vases to African masks.\r\nAt times he used studio props, such as North African furniture, wall hangings and metal work.\r\nMany items on show are being loaned from the Musee Matisse in Nice, France.\r\n\"He did actually call them actors,\" says Burnham.\r\n\"He said; 'The object is an actor. It can have a part in many different plays and play many different roles.'\"\r\nThe exhibit features this 19th century Venetian chair, it served as inspiration for several works, including 'Venetian Chair with Fruit' from 1942.\r\nWhen Matisse found the chair, he wrote to friend Louis Aragon; 'I have at last found the object for which I've been longing for a whole year.'\r\n\"This Rocaille chair, he bought much later in his life, and he wrote to his friend, the writer and resistance fighter Louis Aragon about the chair, the almost passionate response to this chair, so much that Aragon called it Matisse's gigolo,\" says Burnham.\r\nElsewhere, this Andalusian blown glass vase served as inspiration for two paintings, Matisse interpreted its curved green shape like the voluptuous curves of a woman.\r\n\"To him, when he was starting out and he couldn't afford to pay a model,\" explains art critic Estelle Lovatt.\r\n\"He would seek out by travelling the world, he would seek out the most voluptuous, curvaceous, vases and jugs that he could find, because they're very reminiscent of the organic, of the feminine, of the female form.\"\r\nIn later life, Matisse experimented with large, colourful cut-outs. \r\nHe repeatedly spoke about Chinese artists in relation to his own search for simplified signs. \r\nA selection of cut-outs are displayed next to these Chinese porcelain vases.\r\n\"This exhibition is unique for giving us something that no other Matisse exhibition has ever given us before,\" says Lovatt.\r\n\"For example, there's so many works here that I have never seen, and it's so exciting to see his paintings literally come to life. \r\n\"The paintings, and the drawings, and the prints, and the cut-outs, are hanging next to the materials that he touched, and sat on, and loved, loved as much as the people around him. \r\n\"And this is what makes this exhibition unique is that it gives us the full, 3D picture of him.\"\r\nMatisse died in 1954 at the age of 84. \r\n'Matisse in the Studio' runs 5 August - 12 November at London's Royal Academy of Arts.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/acdc6465a50ae9871c50f97a5b1af1d9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
