            "description": "(5 Oct 2017) LEADIN\r\nA BMW roadster that was once owned by Elvis Presley is on show in Berlin as part of the Motorworld Classics car fair. \r\nOther classic cars on display at the event include the original Ford Mustang Eleanor from the film \"Gone in 60 seconds\".\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nThis is one of the undisputed stars of this year's Motorworld Classics car fair in Berlin.\r\nIt's a BMW 507 roadster, made in 1955. The 8-cylinder, 150 horse powered car has a top speed of 205 kilometres per hour and the German car maker only produced 251 of them.\r\nA \"normal\" 507 Roadster will cost between 1.5 and 2.5 million euros, depending on the condition.\r\nBut this one is far from normal - it was once owned by Elvis Presley when he was stationed in Berlin as a US soldier.\r\nLegend has it that he had the car painted red because he got tired of women marking the vehicle with lipstick. A hint on the original red colour has intentionally been left in a small corner behind the driver's door.\r\n\"This is a car with three stories,\" explains Stefan Behr, spokesman for \"BMW classics\", part of the BMW brand that deals with classic cars.\r\n\"To start off, it was a show car at the IAA motor show (in Frankfurt in 1955). Secondly, Hans-Joachim Stueck (Formula One driver) drove this car. And finally, it was also owned by Elvis Presley.\"\r\nElvis Presley was stationed in Germany in 1958-1960 and to get around he bought the BMW 507 roadster.\r\nIn 2006 the car was found in a barn in California by Jackie Jouret, a journalist at Bimmer, a magazine focusing on BMW news.\r\nTracking the serial numbers she confirmed that the car was the same that Elvis drove around in Germany, and also the same as the one Formula One legend Hans-Joachim Stueck had driven.\r\nThe car was eventually sent to Munich in Germany where it was restored by Klaus Kutscher \u2013 an expert in vintage car restoration at BMW Group Classic\r\n\"It is priceless,\" says Behr.\r\n\"The Elvis 507 is not on the market. To know a price you would need to compare it to other products. But this one is not on the market, it is not going to get sold so therefore it is impossible to guess a price.\"\r\nAnother car with a thick sprinkle of stardust is this Ford Mustang Eleanor, made in 1967.\r\nIt is in itself a classic car, loved by collectors worldwide.\r\nBut this is the original car used in the movie \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" with Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie.\r\nIt was one of three Ford Mustang Eleanor vehicles on the set, and it has just been bought by Chrome Cars, based in Jena in Germany.\r\nThe company is planning on using it as a show car for the foreseeable future, but it says if the right buyer with the right offer comes along it would probably sell.\r\nThe company doesn't want to give a price, but Christian Zoellner, the sales manager for Chrome Cars, says that a copy of the same car recently sold for 1.5 million US dollars.\r\n\"Who would buy a car like this? It could be Mustang fans. It could be a collector that buys it as an investment. Or simply just a car enthusiast and fan. I think here you kill like seven birds with one stone. This car is probably not just for Mustang fans,\" he says.\r\nOne car with a similar price-tag is this Mercedes-Benz 300 SL coupe from 1954.\r\nThe sleek sports car is a classic and loved by collectors and enthusiasts.\r\nThis one, in a pristine condition, will set you back 1.5 million euros.\r\nAfter years of growth, the classic car market is still growing, according to Marc Baumueller, CEO of Motorworld.\r\n\"It is like the art market,\" he says.\r\n\"The vehicles are not made anymore so, therefore, the prices are increasing. But it will not always be like that. Just like in an art market the prices can both go up and down. But when you look at the development of the German market then you see that it has become an international market.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/36e7e7fa8175dd5b5644a614fc5b6acc \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(5 Oct 2017) LEADIN:\r\nOne of London's best-known parks is playing host to a wide variety of sculptures by the likes of Eduardo Paolozzi and the cult American artist known as KAWS. \r\nThere's also a strong statement on racial inclusion from British artist Thomas J. Price. \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nFar from Frieze art fair's frantic booths and packed hallways, towering artworks are invading London's autumnal Regents Park.\r\nThe art fair's annual Frieze Sculpture, claimed to be London's largest outdoor exhibition, is showcasing 24 artists.\r\nOne highlight is this towering metallic giant by late Scottish sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. Made in 1999, it was one of Paolozzi's last monumental commissions.\r\nThe sculpture park was curated by Claire Lilley, the director of Yorkshire Sculpture Park. She says it's very different to curating a traditional exhibit.\r\n\"I'm looking for really high-quality sculpture, I'm looking for sculpture that is of interest to major international collectors, but I'm also looking to make an exhibition that is very accessible to a very, very diverse public,\" she says. \r\n\"Because this is a very public park, it's an incredibly busy park, you have people coming here for lunch, you have people coming here with their babies, exercising, people have parties here.\"\r\nAnd since they're not nailed to gallery walls, the artworks can be explored, viewed and interacted with in new and exciting ways.\r\nVisitors can gaze skywards at this upturned elephant by Spanish artist Miquel Barcelo or perhaps become hynotised by this swinging hammock by US artist Sarah Sze.\r\n\"So, the wonderful thing about sculptures is even though they're static, we enable them to move and it's an immersive all encompassing, all sensory experience,\" says art critic Estelle Lovatt.\r\n\"Because we move around the sculpture and as we move around it looks different from every angle.\"\r\nOne highlight is this towering seven-metre tall sculpture by US artist KAWS. \r\nNamed 'FINAL DAYS', it exhibits the artist's unique toy-like style, while at the same time appearing monstrous and domineering.\r\nKAWS is a popular choice for social media fans. He boasts almost 900,000 followers on picture-sharing app Instagram. Over 500,000 more than Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei, for instance.\r\n\"He started work as a street artist, he works with designers, he makes clothing ranges, he has this incredible reach, an enormous, enormously diverse audience and he kind of has a cult following,\" says Lilley.\r\n\"That isn't necessarily important, but what it means is the work is extremely accessible to a very wide public and that's really, really important for people coming into the space, that they have something that can catch hold of, that they can understand, that there's an immediacy.\"\r\nBritish artist Thomas J. Price is showcasing this recent three-part work, named 'Numen (Shifting Votive One, Two and Three)'.\r\nCast in grey aluminium and set on marble plinths, they're intended to resemble commemorative busts.\r\n\"He's dealing with issues which I think are very important within our society, specifically here, the non-representation of black people in the public realm as sculptures, as statues,\" says Lilley.\r\n\"But he's brought his very contemporary bearing to these works, he's cast them in aluminium, which just physically because of the colour of the aluminium, makes them very startling.\"\r\nJapanese artist Takuro Kuwata is showcasing these towering 'tree' sculptures' formed from porcelain, stone, glaze, pigment, steel, gold and laquer.\r\nKuwata often transforms traditional Japanese pottery techniques to create bright, ambitious ceramic works.\r\n\"I think the wonderful thing about having sculptures outside in the park is that it engages with people that are perhaps too afraid to go into a gallery space,\" says Lovatt.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/fa46648b3281cc5121d6d30a71bf43bf \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

The 8-cylinder, 150 horse powered car has a top speed of 205 kilometres per hour and the German car maker only produced 251 of them.\r\nA \"normal\" 507 Roadster will cost between 1.5 and 2.5 million euros, depending on the condition.\r\nBut this one is far from normal - it was once owned by Elvis Presley when he was stationed in Berlin as a US soldier.\r\nLegend has it that he had the car painted red because he got tired of women marking the vehicle with lipstick. A hint on the original red colour has intentionally been left in a small corner behind the driver's door.\r\n\"This is a car with three stories,\" explains Stefan Behr, spokesman for \"BMW classics\", part of the BMW brand that deals with classic cars.\r\n\"To start off, it was a show car at the IAA motor show (in Frankfurt in 1955). Secondly, Hans-Joachim Stueck (Formula One driver) drove this car. And finally, it was also owned by Elvis Presley.\"\r\nElvis Presley was stationed in Germany in 1958-1960 and to get around he bought the BMW 507 roadster.\r\nIn 2006 the car was found in a barn in California by Jackie Jouret, a journalist at Bimmer, a magazine focusing on BMW news.\r\nTracking the serial numbers she confirmed that the car was the same that Elvis drove around in Germany, and also the same as the one Formula One legend Hans-Joachim Stueck had driven.\r\nThe car was eventually sent to Munich in Germany where it was restored by Klaus Kutscher \u2013 an expert in vintage car restoration at BMW Group Classic\r\n\"It is priceless,\" says Behr.\r\n\"The Elvis 507 is not on the market. To know a price you would need to compare it to other products. But this one is not on the market, it is not going to get sold so therefore it is impossible to guess a price.\"\r\nAnother car with a thick sprinkle of stardust is this Ford Mustang Eleanor, made in 1967.\r\nIt is in itself a classic car, loved by collectors worldwide.\r\nBut this is the original car used in the movie \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" with Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie.\r\nIt was one of three Ford Mustang Eleanor vehicles on the set, and it has just been bought by Chrome Cars, based in Jena in Germany.\r\nThe company is planning on using it as a show car for the foreseeable future, but it says if the right buyer with the right offer comes along it would probably sell.\r\nThe company doesn't want to give a price, but Christian Zoellner, the sales manager for Chrome Cars, says that a copy of the same car recently sold for 1.5 million US dollars.\r\n\"Who would buy a car like this? It could be Mustang fans. It could be a collector that buys it as an investment. Or simply just a car enthusiast and fan. I think here you kill like seven birds with one stone. This car is probably not just for Mustang fans,\" he says.\r\nOne car with a similar price-tag is this Mercedes-Benz 300 SL coupe from 1954.\r\nThe sleek sports car is a classic and loved by collectors and enthusiasts.\r\nThis one, in a pristine condition, will set you back 1.5 million euros.\r\nAfter years of growth, the classic car market is still growing, according to Marc Baumueller, CEO of Motorworld.\r\n\"It is like the art market,\" he says.\r\n\"The vehicles are not made anymore so, therefore, the prices are increasing. But it will not always be like that. Just like in an art market the prices can both go up and down. But when you look at the development of the German market then you see that it has become an international market.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/36e7e7fa8175dd5b5644a614fc5b6acc \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

This car is probably not just for Mustang fans,\" he says.\r\nOne car with a similar price-tag is this Mercedes-Benz 300 SL coupe from 1954.\r\nThe sleek sports car is a classic and loved by collectors and enthusiasts.\r\nThis one, in a pristine condition, will set you back 1.5 million euros.\r\nAfter years of growth, the classic car market is still growing, according to Marc Baumueller, CEO of Motorworld.\r\n\"It is like the art market,\" he says.\r\n\"The vehicles are not made anymore so, therefore, the prices are increasing. But it will not always be like that. Just like in an art market the prices can both go up and down. But when you look at the development of the German market then you see that it has become an international market.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/36e7e7fa8175dd5b5644a614fc5b6acc \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Price. \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nFar from Frieze art fair's frantic booths and packed hallways, towering artworks are invading London's autumnal Regents Park.\r\nThe art fair's annual Frieze Sculpture, claimed to be London's largest outdoor exhibition, is showcasing 24 artists.\r\nOne highlight is this towering metallic giant by late Scottish sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. Made in 1999, it was one of Paolozzi's last monumental commissions.\r\nThe sculpture park was curated by Claire Lilley, the director of Yorkshire Sculpture Park. She says it's very different to curating a traditional exhibit.\r\n\"I'm looking for really high-quality sculpture, I'm looking for sculpture that is of interest to major international collectors, but I'm also looking to make an exhibition that is very accessible to a very, very diverse public,\" she says. \r\n\"Because this is a very public park, it's an incredibly busy park, you have people coming here for lunch, you have people coming here with their babies, exercising, people have parties here.\"\r\nAnd since they're not nailed to gallery walls, the artworks can be explored, viewed and interacted with in new and exciting ways.\r\nVisitors can gaze skywards at this upturned elephant by Spanish artist Miquel Barcelo or perhaps become hynotised by this swinging hammock by US artist Sarah Sze.\r\n\"So, the wonderful thing about sculptures is even though they're static, we enable them to move and it's an immersive all encompassing, all sensory experience,\" says art critic Estelle Lovatt.\r\n\"Because we move around the sculpture and as we move around it looks different from every angle.\"\r\nOne highlight is this towering seven-metre tall sculpture by US artist KAWS. \r\nNamed 'FINAL DAYS', it exhibits the artist's unique toy-like style, while at the same time appearing monstrous and domineering.\r\nKAWS is a popular choice for social media fans. He boasts almost 900,000 followers on picture-sharing app Instagram. Over 500,000 more than Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei, for instance.\r\n\"He started work as a street artist, he works with designers, he makes clothing ranges, he has this incredible reach, an enormous, enormously diverse audience and he kind of has a cult following,\" says Lilley.\r\n\"That isn't necessarily important, but what it means is the work is extremely accessible to a very wide public and that's really, really important for people coming into the space, that they have something that can catch hold of, that they can understand, that there's an immediacy.\"\r\nBritish artist Thomas J. Price is showcasing this recent three-part work, named 'Numen (Shifting Votive One, Two and Three)'.\r\nCast in grey aluminium and set on marble plinths, they're intended to resemble commemorative busts.\r\n\"He's dealing with issues which I think are very important within our society, specifically here, the non-representation of black people in the public realm as sculptures, as statues,\" says Lilley.\r\n\"But he's brought his very contemporary bearing to these works, he's cast them in aluminium, which just physically because of the colour of the aluminium, makes them very startling.\"\r\nJapanese artist Takuro Kuwata is showcasing these towering 'tree' sculptures' formed from porcelain, stone, glaze, pigment, steel, gold and laquer.\r\nKuwata often transforms traditional Japanese pottery techniques to create bright, ambitious ceramic works.\r\n\"I think the wonderful thing about having sculptures outside in the park is that it engages with people that are perhaps too afraid to go into a gallery space,\" says Lovatt.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/fa46648b3281cc5121d6d30a71bf43bf \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
