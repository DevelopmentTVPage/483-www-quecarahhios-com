They separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996, the year before Diana died in a car crash in Paris, aged 36.\r\nCharles married his longtime paramour Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005.\r\nIn the recordings, Diana also describes confronting her husband and Parker Bowles at a party - a moment Wharfe says marked \"the real beginning of the end\" of the royal marriage.\r\n\"She realized there was no chance of reconciliation,\" he said. \"There was only one direction, and that was divorce.\" \r\n\"This was the occasion of Camilla's sister's birthday and she and the Prince of Wales went to this party, which to me was slightly surprising, because Diana must have known this was going to be a difficult one, knowing that Camilla would be there, but that wasn't for me to say, I did my bit,\" he recalls.\r\n \"We eventually confronted Charles and Camilla, who were sat on a sofa talking somewhere else in the house. Diana, remarkably calm, said to Camilla, 'Look, don't treat me like an idiot, I know what's going on' and at that point, Camilla said something really strange, which I said in the film, never really understood it, she said 'It's ok for you, you've got two wonderful boys'. Now I knew at this particular point, any chance of any reconciliation here was seriously out of the question and as I say in the film, this was then the real beginning of the end.\"\r\nWharfe - who has a new book coming out on his time with the princess - says the documentary is a valuable reminder of Diana's role in \"the reshaping of the monarchy.\" \r\nHer death unleashed a public outpouring of grief in Britain and around the world. The royal family, whose stoic reserve suddenly seemed out of touch, has since softened its stiff upper lip. \r\nWilliam and Harry both campaign for more open discussion of mental health, and have spoken of their own struggles after their mother's death.\r\n\"They are picking up exactly where their mother left off,\" Wharfe said\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3d9dbd56aaf3f80c03aab18bbcc78514 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Apple's earnings climbed 12 percent to $8.7 billion in the company's latest quarter amid rising demand for iPhones while the iPad snapped out of a 3-1\/2-year sales slump.\r\nRevenue increased 7 percent from last year to $45.4 billion.\r\nThe fiscal third-quarter results announced Tuesday exceeded analysts' projections for the period spanning from April to July 1.\r\nJust as importantly, Apple predicted revenue for its current quarter ending in September will range from $49 billion to $52 billion. That's better than Apple's performance last year when its popular line of iPhone 7 phones came out.\r\nThe upbeat forecast is likely to ease concerns that production problems might delay the release of Apple's next-generation iPhone, which typically comes out in late September. That model is expected to boast a higher-quality screen and several other new features.\r\nIf the release of the next iPhone was going to be delayed until October or even later, analysts were expecting Apple to lower its revenue projections for the current quarter to below $45 billion.\r\nLuca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, declined to comment on the timing of the next iPhone during an interview with The Associated Press.\r\nBesides a bigger and better screen, the next iPhone is expected to include wireless charging and facial recognition technology to unlock the device, based on software coding that Apple mistakenly leaked.\r\nPeople are still snapping up the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus that came out last September, according to Maestri. He said those models are the main reason Apple sold 41 million iPhones in the past quarter, a 2 percent uptick from last year.\r\nIn a long-awaited turnaround, Apple sold 11.4 million iPads in the quarter, a 15 percent increase from last year. It's the first time Apple's quarterly sales of iPads have improved from the previous year since the opening three months of 2014. Maestri cited Apple's efforts to sell more iPads in classrooms as the main reason for the comeback.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/460c18e3cf031faae4e5990d1c2ec662 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Apple's earnings climbed 12 percent to $8.7 billion in the company's latest quarter amid rising demand for iPhones while the iPad snapped out of a 3-1\/2-year sales slump.\r\nRevenue increased 7 percent from last year to $45.4 billion.\r\nThe fiscal third-quarter results announced Tuesday exceeded analysts' projections for the period spanning from April to July 1.\r\nJust as importantly, Apple predicted revenue for its current quarter ending in September will range from $49 billion to $52 billion. That's better than Apple's performance last year when its popular line of iPhone 7 phones came out.\r\nThe upbeat forecast is likely to ease concerns that production problems might delay the release of Apple's next-generation iPhone, which typically comes out in late September. That model is expected to boast a higher-quality screen and several other new features.\r\nIf the release of the next iPhone was going to be delayed until October or even later, analysts were expecting Apple to lower its revenue projections for the current quarter to below $45 billion.\r\nLuca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, declined to comment on the timing of the next iPhone during an interview with The Associated Press.\r\nBesides a bigger and better screen, the next iPhone is expected to include wireless charging and facial recognition technology to unlock the device, based on software coding that Apple mistakenly leaked.\r\nPeople are still snapping up the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus that came out last September, according to Maestri. He said those models are the main reason Apple sold 41 million iPhones in the past quarter, a 2 percent uptick from last year.\r\nIn a long-awaited turnaround, Apple sold 11.4 million iPads in the quarter, a 15 percent increase from last year. It's the first time Apple's quarterly sales of iPads have improved from the previous year since the opening three months of 2014. Maestri cited Apple's efforts to sell more iPads in classrooms as the main reason for the comeback.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/460c18e3cf031faae4e5990d1c2ec662 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Brazilians reacted with mixed feelings a day after congress voted to not proceed with corruption charges against President Michel Temer.\r\nTemer survived a key congressional vote that could have suspended him over a bribery charge, mustering enough support Wednesday night to stay in office and avoid being tried by the country's highest court.\r\nPresident Michel Temer needed the support of just one-third of the 513 members of the lower Chamber of Deputies. \r\nIn the end 263 deputies voted for the president and 227 voted against him. The remaining were abstentions and absences.\r\nThe bribery allegation, which stunned even Brazilians inured to graft cases, was the latest in a bevy of scandals that has rocked the administration and created deep uncertainty and angst in Latin America's largest nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/792f5b3f7054a64c8be6e78fb014e89b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
