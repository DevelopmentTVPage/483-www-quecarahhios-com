            "description": "(28 Sep 2017) San Francisco 49ers defensive back Eric Reid said he hopes that the criticism President Donald Trump directed at NFL players protesting during the national anthem will help bring awareness to the issues that former 49ers teammate Colin Kaepernick hoped to raise when he began his protest last year.\r\nKaepernick sat during the national anthem because of police brutality and racial discrimination and the protest grew with a handful of other players like Reid joining Kaepernick. It became much more extensive Sunday when the 49ers had the day off.\r\nMore than 200 NFL players kneeled or raised fists during the anthem and almost three entire teams stayed in the locker room in response to Trump saying NFL owners should fire players who kneel during the anthem and describing those protesters with the term \"son of a bitch.\"\r\nReid said some of the issues he and Kaepernick are concerned about are police brutality against minorities, social injustice, unfair incarceration rates for minorities and a bail system that keeps many people locked up before they have been convicted of a crime.\r\n\"I hoped that when we started we could make some changes. I hoped that we could make our country better through doing the protest. No, I didn't think that we would get this kind of remark from the president,\" Reid said. \r\nHe cited statistics from Harvard Ph.D. candidate Clint Smith and talked about how many New Deal policies in the 1930s excluded many minorities and have helped create issues of inequality that remain today. He also talked about an op-ed piece he wrote for The New York Times this week explaining the protests.\r\nThe 49ers held meetings Monday to discuss how they will handle protests and the national anthem on Sunday in Arizona. There was a team-wide meeting and the leadership council of about a dozen players met with coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch.\r\nThey are still deciding what they will do but Reid said he didn't want to force anyone to do something they weren't comfortable doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9c11894c81b767f22abec288a5c1c6da \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
