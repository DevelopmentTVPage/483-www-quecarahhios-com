                "description": "(22 Sep 2017) With immigrants and their advocates chanting and beating drums outside, a federal appeals court heard arguments Friday on whether it should allow a Texas law aimed at combatting so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d to immediately take effect.\r\nUnder the law, Texas police chiefs could face removal from office and criminal charges for not complying with federal immigration officials\u2019 requests to detain people jailed on non-immigration offenses.\r\nU.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia blocked much of the law Aug. 31 _ the day before it was to take effect. \r\nThe state appealed to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\r\nArguments on Garcia\u2019s injunction against parts of the law are scheduled for the week of November 6. \r\nHowever, state officials, joined by the U.S. Justice Department, sought an emergency stay allowing enforcement to begin. \r\nThat request was before a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit on Friday morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5544b3c812cbd9d48631060b7c6729dc \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
