The company claims that its units can produce 40 per cent more power compared to traditional rooftop solar systems.\r\nWith a sunflower-inspired design, the 194 square-foot (59 square-metre) unit has 12 petals of solar panels attached to a dual-axis tracker. \r\nThis allows the system to take advantage of maximum sun exposure by tracking light rays from sunrise to sunset, a feature that clearly differentiates the Smartflower POP from rooftop panels which absorb light from a fixed angle.\r\nEach unit is programmed to work autonomously after the initial set-up. At the first ray of light the system opens, or rather blooms, to expand its petals for the day.\r\nIt shuts down on its own when it detects that the sun has set and, with soft bristles underneath each petal, it cleans itself in the process. \r\nIn bad weather like heavy rain it detects the wind speed and automatically closes to avoid any damage to the petals. Since it is an all-in-one 'plug and play' system it can also be transported when needed if the owner moves house.\r\nIt generates around 3,400 to 6,200 kWh per year depending on the region. If a client has a higher energy requirement, Smartflower also offers customised units with upgraded electricity production.\r\nThe Philippines' first Smartflower POP unit was installed at De La Salle Lipa (DLSL), an educational institution in a province about an hour away from the capital Manila. \r\nArnold Capuloy, Chief Strategy and Advancement Officer at De La Salle Lipa, says the school wanted to set an example and educate the community about doing their part to save the environment:\r\n\"This one is a conversation piece. By getting their attention it will give us a time for us to share our advocacy, to share with them the reason why we are using this and an appeal actually. It's time for us to make an appeal to them to do the same,\" he says.\r\nBecause of its 'plug-and play' promise, it took just 2 hours to install the Smartflower POP. After it was mounted, exact coordinates for it to track the sun were then inputted.\r\nThe Philippines still heavily depends on fossil fuels for power. Coal generated 48 per cent of the country's power in 2016 according to the Department of Energy. \r\nBut with a National Renewable Energy Programme in place, more efforts are being made to produce greener energy. And companies like Smartflower are now offering Filipinos a wider choice of renewable energy options.\r\nPaul Cabacungan is Head of Operations at the Ateneo Innovation Center, which specialises in designing solar-powered devices to help remote communities have off-the-grid independence.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/87da840e6dd342a4a6ac7f53fa611df7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

The company claims that its units can produce 40 per cent more power compared to traditional rooftop solar systems.\r\nWith a sunflower-inspired design, the 194 square-foot (59 square-metre) unit has 12 petals of solar panels attached to a dual-axis tracker. \r\nThis allows the system to take advantage of maximum sun exposure by tracking light rays from sunrise to sunset, a feature that clearly differentiates the Smartflower POP from rooftop panels which absorb light from a fixed angle.\r\nEach unit is programmed to work autonomously after the initial set-up. At the first ray of light the system opens, or rather blooms, to expand its petals for the day.\r\nIt shuts down on its own when it detects that the sun has set and, with soft bristles underneath each petal, it cleans itself in the process. \r\nIn bad weather like heavy rain it detects the wind speed and automatically closes to avoid any damage to the petals. Since it is an all-in-one 'plug and play' system it can also be transported when needed if the owner moves house.\r\nIt generates around 3,400 to 6,200 kWh per year depending on the region. If a client has a higher energy requirement, Smartflower also offers customised units with upgraded electricity production.\r\nThe Philippines' first Smartflower POP unit was installed at De La Salle Lipa (DLSL), an educational institution in a province about an hour away from the capital Manila. \r\nArnold Capuloy, Chief Strategy and Advancement Officer at De La Salle Lipa, says the school wanted to set an example and educate the community about doing their part to save the environment:\r\n\"This one is a conversation piece. By getting their attention it will give us a time for us to share our advocacy, to share with them the reason why we are using this and an appeal actually. It's time for us to make an appeal to them to do the same,\" he says.\r\nBecause of its 'plug-and play' promise, it took just 2 hours to install the Smartflower POP. After it was mounted, exact coordinates for it to track the sun were then inputted.\r\nThe Philippines still heavily depends on fossil fuels for power. Coal generated 48 per cent of the country's power in 2016 according to the Department of Energy. \r\nBut with a National Renewable Energy Programme in place, more efforts are being made to produce greener energy.

            "description": "(4 Aug 2017) The director of national intelligence is warning about leaks of classified information, saying that anyone who does will be prosecuted to the 'fullest extent of the law'.\r\nDan Coats, the director of national intelligence expressed 'grave concern' over the leak of classified information, and the Trump administration is stepping up efforts to crack down on them.\r\nThe announcement at the Justice Department comes one week after President Donald Trump complained that Sessions was weak in cracking down on leaks and as a White House adviser raised the possibility of lie detector tests for people inside the administration. It also comes amid a series of news reports this year involving the Trump campaign and White House that relied on classified information. \r\nTrump's outbursts against media organizations he derides as \"fake news\" have led to concerns that the administration will more aggressively try to root out leaks following stories that officials see as negative, and the timing of the Sessions announcement one week after he was criticized by the president for being weak on \"intel leakers\"  raised the possibility that he was acting to quell the anger of the man who appointed him.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1bc32b3cb3b14fc51f118d702295a862 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
