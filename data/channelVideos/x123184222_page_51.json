It's too late to be a first responder. I tell jokes. I do tricks and this is, well I'm afraid to say quite literally the least I can do.

My dad, I brag, was the biggest blood donor in Greenfield, Massachusetts,\" Jillette said.\r\nHe insists the show must go on. \r\n\"It was a horrible, horrible tragedy, but then you must go back to what you do. As a matter of fact, I think I tend to be on the other side of that. I think we start going to what we do right away. We took our show off last night to be respectful, but those people that were shot, they didn't want the world to stop. Nobody wants the world to stop when there's a tragedy. They want it to go on. And you know Vegas is, Vegas is Vegas. It's always going to be there and what I think the one thing we shown is what happens in Vegas, goes all around the world,\" he said. \r\nJillette and his performing partner Raymond Teller host a \"13 Bloody Days of Christmas\" every year, where people in Vegas who donate blood during that time get free tickets to their show.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/aa263bd6153ae548bfbb445ff31fd178 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(5 Oct 2017) LAS VEGAS MAGICIAN SUPPORTS LOCAL BLOOD DONATION CENTER\r\nPenn Jillette, of the well-known magic duo Penn &amp; Teller, was among the hundreds of people who came to give blood and platelets in Las Vegas following the mass shooting Sunday night at Mandalay Bay Resort. \r\n\"At my age it's too late to be an EMT. It's too late to be a first responder. I tell jokes. I do tricks and this is, well I'm afraid to say quite literally the least I can do. It also sadly might be the most I could do,\" he said while donating. \r\nJillette was giving platelets at United Blood Services in Las Vegas, something he says he tries to do at least a few times a year. \r\n\"I come from a long line of blood donors. My dad, I brag, was the biggest blood donor in Greenfield, Massachusetts,\" Jillette said.\r\nHe insists the show must go on. \r\n\"It was a horrible, horrible tragedy, but then you must go back to what you do. As a matter of fact, I think I tend to be on the other side of that. I think we start going to what we do right away. We took our show off last night to be respectful, but those people that were shot, they didn't want the world to stop. Nobody wants the world to stop when there's a tragedy. They want it to go on. And you know Vegas is, Vegas is Vegas. It's always going to be there and what I think the one thing we shown is what happens in Vegas, goes all around the world,\" he said. \r\nJillette and his performing partner Raymond Teller host a \"13 Bloody Days of Christmas\" every year, where people in Vegas who donate blood during that time get free tickets to their show.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/aa263bd6153ae548bfbb445ff31fd178 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Thursday was the deadline for the 154,000 recipients eligible to reapply.\r\nThe rush of paperwork was prompted by the Trump's Administration's announcement in September that DACA would be phased out in March. Until then, the Trump Administration said Congress needed to address the issue of immigrants who were brought to this country by their parents as children. DACA was created by President Barack Obama in 2012 and nearly 700,000 immigrants were under the program.\r\n\"DACA has given so many opportunities for me and many of my other family members, to give us new jobs, a new shot at life,\" said Perla Montoya, who filled out her renewal application on Monday. \"\"Being a single mom with a four year old that has autism is really hard. Knowing that it could be the end of this for me, leaving my autistic child behind is really hard. It's really hard, watching the news, all my dreams coming down hill.\"\r\nAround the country immigrant advocacy organizations and legal aid offices deployed volunteers to help DACA recipients fill out their forms. In Washington state, an anonymous donor donated $125,000 to cover the $495 DACA renewal fee. \r\nBut under Trump's administration arrests of immigrants illegally in the country have increased, including those without criminal records and even some DACA recipients. The renewal process hasn't been without trepidation. \r\n \"I think one of the questions people have is 'should I be providing my address?'\" said Jorge Baron, executive director at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. \"Our advice is that we can't guarantee that information won't be used against them in the future. But on balance, if they don't have the risk factors, like criminal history or prior deportation orders, we think it's more of a benefit to move forward with the renewal than not.\"\r\nBeyond initial rumors of negotiations between Democrats and President Trump, Republican leadership in Congress has not signaled they will move forward with a fix. Meanwhile, young immigrants, often called Dreamers, have begun lobbying lawmakers to pass a bill, one that would not include more money for immigration enforcement.\r\nFor Montoya, she hopes to hear back soon on her renewal. Her DACA expires in December and she doesn't want to leave her job at Nordstrom's.    \r\n\"I woke up this morning with mixed emotions, not knowing if my application will go okay, will everything be okay?

                "description": "(3 Oct 2017) ACCORDING TO A GOVERNMENT STUDY... MORE THAN 15 MILLION ADULTS IN THE US HAVE PROBLEMS WITH ALCOHOL.\r\nYET LESS THAN 10 PERCENT OF THEM GET TREATMENT.\r\nTHE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM IS HOPING TO CHANGE THAT BY MAKING IT EASIER TO CONNECT PEOPLE TO HELP.\r\nSOUNDBITE (English)  Lori Ducharme. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. \"Often time people think their only options are either Alcoholics Anonymous or some other mutual help group or a long-term residential rehab program and sometimes people either don't want or don't need those options. So what we've done in the Navigator is show you all the other options in between.\"\r\nA NEW ONLINE TOOL CALLED THE NAVIGATOR ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SEARCH THROUGH 100,000 THERAPISTS, 5,000 ACCREDITED TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND 4,000 ADDICTION DOCTORS.  IT ALSO HELPS PEOPLE EVALUATE PROVIDERS.\r\nSOUNDBITE (English)  Lori Ducharme, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. \"Then you need to call them and ask them questions to find out if they will be the right fit for you. And we give you those questions to ask and the right answers to listen for.\"\r\nWHILE THE PREMISE FOR THE TOOL IS STRAIGHTFORWARD, FAMILIES STRUGGLING WITH ALCOHOL DISORDERS SAY UNTIL NOW, THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE OBJECTIVE INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN ONE CENTRAL PLACE.\r\nSOUNDBITE (English)  Robert Wear, daughter has alcohol problems. \"I'd Google it and whatever and it has information but it's largely driven by advertisements.\"\r\nROBERT WEAR KNOWS THE PAIN FIRST HAND.. HIS 21 YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER HAS GONE THROUGH A SERIES OF TREATMENTS.\r\nSOUNDBITE (English)  Robert Wear, daughter has alcohol problems. \"There are not so great programs out there so it's easy to get misled. People are desperate and they'd rather have their loved ones be anywhere but where they are at.\"\r\nWHILE THE SITE DOESN'T SOLVE THE ISSUES OF ACCESSIBILITY AND AFFORDABILITY... THE AGENCY BEHIND THE NAVIGATOR SAYS IT ARMS PEOPLE WITH INFORMATION TO LEAD THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.\r\nSOUNDBITE (English)  Lori Ducharme, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. \"Do they do a comprehensive assessment? Do they offer you a customized and responsive treatment plan, meaning it's not one size fits all treatment?\"\r\nA TOOL TO HELP FAMILIES NAVIGATE THROUGH TOUGH TIMES.  \r\nCARRIE ANTLFINGER, ASSOCIATED PRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/d48c1d40fdc2329b00930d5daa9cd1f4 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
