            "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Paul Peddle was watching television Sunday night when he saw news of the Las Vegas shooting. Something clicked for Peddle, who owns B &amp; S Guns in Garland, Texas, when he heard shooter Stephen Paddock once lived in Mesquite, Texas, just a few miles from his shop.\r\nPeddle said he came in Monday, and searched Paddock's name in the sales system. \r\nHe said Paddock had purchased pistols and a revolver on several occasions in 2010 and 2011. \r\nPeddle said Paddock came into the shop with his girlfriend Marilou Danley in 2016, but did not buy anything on that visit.\r\n\"He never purchased any long guns here, nothing that would have been used in the attack,\" Peddle said.\r\n\"If you had to meet him the last time he was in here in 2016, you would never have an assumption that he was anything other than a very cordial extremely nice person,\" he said. \"He had his handgun license. He had everything. All the criteria was taken care of. So there was no immediate red flag up.\"\r\nAs he spoke, customers came in and out of the store. Peddle and his staff remembered all of them regardless of how long ago they had been in to shop. He asked one woman about her daughter's wedding and how the catering had gone. Peddle's bulldogs wander the store freely. Woody, his 11-month-old puppy greeted every customer Wednesday.\r\n\"We know everyone who comes in. It's just the kind of store we are. When we saw the photo of his girlfriend, we definitely remembered her,\" Peddle said. \"She sat on the floor for more than an hour and a half playing with my dogs. She loved them. I sent her photos of her playing with them to her phone.\"\r\nPeddle said Paddock asked questions during that 2016 visit, but did not make any purchases. \r\nHe said he asked about \"Trigger pulls\" and modifications he could make to his guns. Peddle said trigger pulls are used to lighten the spring on triggers.\r\nHe said the couple were very kind to each other, noting that Danley was walking with a \"tricked out\" cane with bedazzling on it because of a surgery. Peddle remembered Paddock walking her to the car and helping her get up.\r\n\"He was very charismatic with her, very sweet. That's the word I would use,\" he said. \"I didn't sense any tension. She couldn't really care at all about the guns. We could have been selling furniture and she wouldn't have cared. She was just in love with our puppies.\"\r\nPeddle said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms came to get his sales records Tuesday. \r\nHe said he didn't have the surveillance footage from 2016 because ATF had previously collected that footage for its investigation into the July 7 Dallas sniper attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/770321f4de3bacbd41f78d0dfb234e49 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
