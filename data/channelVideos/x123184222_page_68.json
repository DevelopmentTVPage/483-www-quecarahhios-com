            "description": "(26 Sep 2017) COMIC LEGEND STAN LEE TO RAISE MONEY FOR IRMA VICTIMS\r\nComic-book publisher Stan Lee has been writing about superheroes for his entire career, and now he's hoping to be one himself for some of the victims of Hurricane Irma.\r\nThe co-creator of Spider-Man, Iron Man, Daredevil and tons of other Marvel Comics characters is coming to MegaCon Tampa Bay this weekend, and he's working with organizers to raise money for storm victims.\r\n\"I feel there's something everybody has to do to help the victims of the weather, of the hurricane,\" Lee said. \"And if I can do my part by auctioning some stuff off, I'm more than happy to do it.\"\r\nLee is auctioning off a one-on-one meal, as well as artwork from his personal collection, during his panel on Friday. Convention organizer Andrew Moyes said they're also donating $5 each from 2,000 tickets sold online to Feeding Florida, a statewide network of food banks that are providing storm victims with food and emergency supplies. Between the auction and ticket sales, MegaCon Tampa Bay and fans should donate an estimated $20,000 for hurricane relief.\r\n\"We really felt that Florida was in need of that extra bit of magic,\" Moyes said. \"What better person to inject some inspiration and cheer than Stan Lee himself?\"\r\nLee wasn't originally scheduled to attend the Tampa event, but Moyes said they had worked with him previously for other conventions and knew Lee would be a great addition following the beating Florida took when Hurricane Irma made landfall on Sept. 10.\r\n\"He was on board right away to help out any way he can,\" Moyes said. \"That's just the type of person he is.\"\r\nWhile Lee is happy to help the storm victims, the 94-year-old said he gets the added enjoyment of meeting with fans and talking about comics.\r\n\"I keep saying, I've got to slow down somehow,\" Lee said. \"And then I hear that there's a new convention, and I can't resist. I've got to be in it.\"\r\nAfter more than half a century, Lee's affection for comics and the characters he helped create is as strong as ever.\r\n\"The thing that impresses me the most is the fact these characters have lasted, have lived this long, even without me writing them,\" Lee said. \"In fact, some of the writers now may be a hell of a lot better than I was. The characters live and thrive, and they're more popular than ever. As their father, you might say, that's really a good feeling.\"\r\nMegaCon Tampa Bay runs from Sept. 29-Oct. 1 at the Tampa Convention Center. Other celebrity guests include William Shatner (\"Star Trek\") and John Barrowman (\"Arrow\" and \"Doctor Who\").\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/59d5477abc488c743d26c5dc190643c1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(26 Sep 2017) Sen. Luther Strange and firebrand jurist Roy Moore faced off Tuesday in the Alabama Republican primary runoff in a race that has pitted President Donald Trump against his former strategist, Steve Bannon. \r\nThe winner of the runoff will become the favorite in December's election against Democrat Doug Jones to fill the remainder of Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Senate term.\r\nTrailing in the polls, Strange has looked to the White House to help make up ground against Moore, the former Alabama chief justice who is best known for defiant stands against gay marriage and for the public display of the Ten Commandments. \r\nVice President Mike Pence campaigned for Strange in Birmingham, Alabama, while Bannon, speaking at a Moore rally, argued Moore is a better fit for Trump's \"populist\" movement.\r\nStrange supporter Hayden Lee, who works in insurance sales, said she didn't have an opinion of Moore but voted for the incumbent solely because Trump endorsed him.\r\n\"I'm just trying to make everything work,\" Lee said after voting in Pelham. \"I think you've got to get along with the president to make it work.\"\r\nMerlene Bohannon, a widow with three grown children, said she had planned to vote for Strange until seeing Bannon stump for Moore on Fox News on Monday night.\r\n\"Steve Bannon and God spoke to me, and this morning when I went in I voted for Moore,\" said Bohannon, 74.\r\nA super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has pumped millions of dollars into the Alabama race on behalf of Strange. \r\nBannon has argued Alabama can show the world that his populist, nationalist, conservative movement is on the rise.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/784e81dd506f3ea244e5a8c24a5af5b9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
