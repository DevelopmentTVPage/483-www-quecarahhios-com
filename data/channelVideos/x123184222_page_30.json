Again it taps into the concept of kinship and the concept of cultures influencing one another but in terms of the actual look of the garment, if we think about Qipao, Chinese Qipao dresses, if we think about the frogging, the details on the dress, if we think about silk becoming more important across the board, even at mass market level, kimonos, kimonos have already been huge but they are continuing to do really well. So definitely we are seeing Eastern inspired influences coming through,\" she says.\r\nAnn Edwards, founder of Mame Huku luxury handbags, takes traditional Japanese fabrics and crafts them into very modern designs. \r\nEach of her bags is unique and made from vintage obis - the central sash of a kimono dress.\r\n\"I've been collecting the fabrics for about 10 years. I'm a little bit obsessed now with Japanese textiles and each piece of fabric is a unique, one off piece that was commissioned specifically for the young woman in the family who made it,\" Edwards says.\r\nShe says her husband got so sick of her collection of silks cluttering up the house that he convinced her to find a new purpose for them, and so Mame Huku was born.\r\nFor Edwards the quality of the original Japanese silk weavers is what sets the bags apart.\r\n\"I'm crazy about the Japanese fabric because the quality of it is just unbelievable. I don't think we could even make fabric like this in the West. How the gold and the silver is woven, and the pure silks. The gradation, if you just look at the gradation of the silk within this it's amazing. You know, we do not do that and do not have any history of doing that,\" she says.\r\nHer bags cost around 500 UK pounds (approx. 650 US dollars) each. \r\nBut if you do splash out on one, it's unlikely you'll find anyone else with the same bag as you. \r\nSingaporean fashion designer Mashizan Masjum is at Pure to introduce his luxury shoes to the UK.\r\nHis shoes cost around 400 UK pounds (approx. 520 US dollars) a pair and the leather is cut and produced in Italy.\r\nMashizan says way the East is influencing fashion at Pure is all about the future, not the past. \r\n\"It's not the old Orientalism that we're talking about here, this is the new 21st Century where I mean China is a huge market for everyone around the world and it is a dominant global power, but at the same time I think with the rise of emerging designers from Asia I think that's something that people will start to notice, that creativity exists a lot in Asia as well,\" he says.\r\nMashizan is upbeat about the UK's exit from the EU, saying it could open up some exciting opportunities. \r\nAnd Brexit isn't keeping international brands away from exhibiting at the show. \r\nThere are buyers and visitors from 87 countries at the show.\r\nPure London runs until 25 July 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cf7928a5763f7c40716f0a950b0abb9f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(24 Jul 2017) LEADIN:\r\nFashion is looking East for inspiration at the Pure London trade show. \r\nEastern-inspired fabrics and styles are tipped to be on trend for Spring\/Summer 2018.  \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nDesigns with an Eastern flair are hitting the catwalk at one of London's top fashion events.\r\nThe Pure London trade show gives retailers and buyers the chance to see what's hot a year before it appears on the high street.\r\nThis show is looking ahead to Spring\/Summer 2018.\r\nThese models are all wearing outfits with Eastern-inspired designs.\r\nThe theme for this show is 'Oriental Futures'. \r\nBut there's more to Eastern design than Chinese lanterns, silk and conical hats.\r\nSara Maggioni is a retail and buying director at the London-based international trend forecasting company WGSN. \r\nShe believes Eastern-inspired fashion is likely to be part of a wider trend involving themes of kinship, versatility and blurring of traditional style categories. \r\n\"Eastern inspired design is a key influence as well for Spring\/Summer '18. Again it taps into the concept of kinship and the concept of cultures influencing one another but in terms of the actual look of the garment, if we think about Qipao, Chinese Qipao dresses, if we think about the frogging, the details on the dress, if we think about silk becoming more important across the board, even at mass market level, kimonos, kimonos have already been huge but they are continuing to do really well. So definitely we are seeing Eastern inspired influences coming through,\" she says.\r\nAnn Edwards, founder of Mame Huku luxury handbags, takes traditional Japanese fabrics and crafts them into very modern designs. \r\nEach of her bags is unique and made from vintage obis - the central sash of a kimono dress.\r\n\"I've been collecting the fabrics for about 10 years. I'm a little bit obsessed now with Japanese textiles and each piece of fabric is a unique, one off piece that was commissioned specifically for the young woman in the family who made it,\" Edwards says.\r\nShe says her husband got so sick of her collection of silks cluttering up the house that he convinced her to find a new purpose for them, and so Mame Huku was born.\r\nFor Edwards the quality of the original Japanese silk weavers is what sets the bags apart.\r\n\"I'm crazy about the Japanese fabric because the quality of it is just unbelievable. I don't think we could even make fabric like this in the West. How the gold and the silver is woven, and the pure silks. The gradation, if you just look at the gradation of the silk within this it's amazing. You know, we do not do that and do not have any history of doing that,\" she says.\r\nHer bags cost around 500 UK pounds (approx. 650 US dollars) each. \r\nBut if you do splash out on one, it's unlikely you'll find anyone else with the same bag as you. \r\nSingaporean fashion designer Mashizan Masjum is at Pure to introduce his luxury shoes to the UK.\r\nHis shoes cost around 400 UK pounds (approx. 520 US dollars) a pair and the leather is cut and produced in Italy.\r\nMashizan says way the East is influencing fashion at Pure is all about the future, not the past. \r\n\"It's not the old Orientalism that we're talking about here, this is the new 21st Century where I mean China is a huge market for everyone around the world and it is a dominant global power, but at the same time I think with the rise of emerging designers from Asia I think that's something that people will start to notice, that creativity exists a lot in Asia as well,\" he says.\r\nMashizan is upbeat about the UK's exit from the EU, saying it could open up some exciting opportunities. \r\nAnd Brexit isn't keeping international brands away from exhibiting at the show. \r\nThere are buyers and visitors from 87 countries at the show.\r\nPure London runs until 25 July 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cf7928a5763f7c40716f0a950b0abb9f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

It was tailor made for them to give them real experience instead of just on flat screen TV. It really gives them\u2026 I hope we can provide dreams for all the people out there,\" says app developer, Leonard Fong. \r\nGamers can tour the likes of Tokyo or Bangkok for as little as USD $6 per trip. \r\n\"I think what it is, is the people these days, they tend to like to stay home. Maybe they spend less money by staying home, they like to have the information through iPhones, So I believe this VR, with the people who like to stay home more, it really creates an imaginary world for them, but it's very real with these VR glasses on. We tried it ourselves, it's pretty real,\" says Fong. \r\nEric Cheung - a 30 year accountant visiting the fair is trying out the app for the first time.  \r\n\"This is the first VR game of its kind in Hong Kong. I can learn how to chase a girl. The VR device allows us to experience a realistic feeling,\" he says. \r\nGaming giant, Playstation has set up an area at the fair inviting gamers to compete and audiences to watch the live action.  \r\nVirtual reality is taking over the gaming world - on show today are new shooting, driving and sports games - all with a VR element.\r\nBut Playstation says live streaming is also enjoying a huge growth in players as well as viewers ahead of the Asian Games 2022 when e-sports will become an official medal event.\r\n\"I think there will be more people who never used to play games getting to know gaming. Because e-sport is not only for gaming lovers, it is also for people who like to watch gamers playing. Live-streaming is on trend now and it is an inseparable part of e-sport. The audience can learn more about gaming through live-streaming, I think this will be the biggest impact. Let's use Hong Kong as an example, in the past there were less people watching e-sports, but in this year there are more discussions on e-sports in the government and also in the industry,\" says Jacqueline Chiu, Assistant General Manager at Sony Interactive Entertainment Hong Kong. \r\nAni-Com &amp; Games Hong Kong is now in its 11th year.

I am still coming to Tunisia,\" she says.\r\nThe Tunisian Federation of Hotels (FTH) has released figures showing a 29.3 percent rise in tourists in the first six months of the year compared to the same period in 2016.\r\nAlgerian visitors are up 61.2 percent to more than 760,000 and Libyan tourists have risen 30.6 percent to almost 620,000.\r\nTunisia's traditional markets are also recovering: French tourists have risen by 43.2 percent to more than 200,000.\r\nRussian tourist Maria says there is \"no fear\" in coming to Tunisia.\r\nThe FTH predicts the number of European tourists will grow 30 percent to 2 million visitors.\r\nThat could be helped by a recent decision by the British government to relax its travel advice.\r\nIt is no longer cautioning against travelling to Tunisia, except for certain regions of the country.\r\n\"The travel ban and the removal of restrictions on visiting Tunisia is a sign of confidence in the security in Tunisia,\" says Afif Kchok Director of Tunisian Observatory of Tourism.\r\n\"This will improve tourism because Britain is a large market and also a strong sign to other European countries that Tunisia is safe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/7822b9cd8bfb372c7607be0afc5096ba \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
