                "description": "(27 Sep 2017) The Kurdish referendum on independence from Iraq was approved by more than 92 percent of voters, officials said on Wednesday, as Iraq's prime minister vowed to keep his country united without resorting to the use of force.\r\nHendrin Mohammed, the head of the Kurdish region's election commission, announced the official results at a press conference, saying the referendum passed with 92.73 percent support and turnout of more than 72 percent.\r\nEven with the strong support, the non-binding vote is unlikely to lead to formal independence, but it has escalated long-running tensions with Baghdad, which has moved to block flights in and out of the Kurds' autonomous region. \r\nIraq and its neighbours, along with virtually the entire international community, are opposed to any redrawing of the map.\r\nThe vote was held across the autonomous Kurdish region's three provinces as well as in some disputed territories controlled by Kurdish forces but claimed by Baghdad.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/166cf79f79f18781e70d3c80abdd16a3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

He said the worst problems were on Hatteras Island, where more than 10,000 visitors left under an evacuation order, but hundreds of local residents were allowed to stay.\r\nThe National Hurricane Center said an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft measured Maria's top sustained winds at near 75 mph (120 kmh), with higher gusts. Its center was about 165 miles (265 kilometers) off Cape Hatteras at 11 a.m.\r\nWhile Maria's most punishing hurricane-force winds remained offshore, tropical storm-force winds extended for as much as 230 miles (370 kilometers) from the center, churning up the surf on both sides of the islands. The hurricane's forward speed is just 6 mph (9 kph), so the storm was lingering before swinging out to sea.\r\nOn Hatteras, a fine rain fell Wednesday, with patches of blue sky occasionally showing through. Police set up a check point to block all traffic except for residents and reporters. As the winds picked up, waves crashed up to and beyond ocean-front homes between the communities of Rodanthe and Avon, where the water has washed under waterfront homes and onto side streets since Tuesday at high tide.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a99279109145df45cdd2799945b94089 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
