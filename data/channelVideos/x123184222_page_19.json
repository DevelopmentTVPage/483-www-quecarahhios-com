            "description": "(1 Oct 2017) LEAD IN:\r\nAlexandria has held a special event to celebrate the ancient leader Cleopatra.\r\nActors paraded through the streets to bring attention to the sunken palace of Cleopatra which lies on the seabed of the city's harbour.\r\n\r\nSTORY-LINE:\r\nDressed in the costumes of their ancient ancestors, Egyptians parade through the streets of Alexandria.\r\nActors are playing the soldiers and handmaids of Queen Cleopatra, the last ruler of the Ptolemaic dynasty.\r\nThe legendary leader emerges, pulled past the crowds on a golden throne by her soldiers.\r\nThe event has been named 'Cleopatra's Dream' and it has taken a lot of effort to make sure this huge procession works like clockwork.\r\nActor Mahmoud Abd Elaziz plays the soldiers' commander.\r\n\"We did 17 rehearsals: ten in the studios and seven outdoors. It was not easy,\" he says.\r\nThe parade passes along the Alexandria Corniche, from the Citadel of Qaitbay towards the diving centre at the Eastern Port.\r\nThis event is being held to draw attention to the sunken city of Cleopatra in the sea around Alexandria. \r\nHundreds of lost antiquities have been found in Alexandria's coastal waters in recent years. In 2015, over 200 treasures from Ancient Egyptian times were discovered.\r\nIt adds to the country's rich history - something the actors have studied closely for their roles.\r\n\"We studied the things they used like jewellery and colours. For example the colour blue symbolises the sky, and they were always aiming for eternal life,\" says Shery Kamal, who plays a maid.\r\n\"We also studied other things like make-up and the importance of the scarab.\"\r\nThe celebration comes hot on the heels of World Tourism Day and has been organised in coordination with the Ministry of Tourism and the Tourism Promotion Authority.\r\nSince the uprising that toppled former president Hosni Mubarak in 2011, Egypt's tourism industry has taken a heavy toll.\r\nIn 2016, in an attempt to bring back foreign visitors, the country's Ministry of Antiquities announced a plan to establish what it dubbed the world's first underwater museum to showcase the submerged relics of Alexandria's ancient treasures.\r\nThe plan has not yet been carried out, but the director of today's show hopes events like this might help attract more visitors.\r\n\"We have created a street carnival that represents the dream of Cleopatra in order to activate tourism.

It was not easy,\" he says.\r\nThe parade passes along the Alexandria Corniche, from the Citadel of Qaitbay towards the diving centre at the Eastern Port.\r\nThis event is being held to draw attention to the sunken city of Cleopatra in the sea around Alexandria. \r\nHundreds of lost antiquities have been found in Alexandria's coastal waters in recent years. In 2015, over 200 treasures from Ancient Egyptian times were discovered.\r\nIt adds to the country's rich history - something the actors have studied closely for their roles.\r\n\"We studied the things they used like jewellery and colours.

For me, the damage done was beyond the moral, it wasn't really just material.\"\r\nHe adds: \"I believe that even if there is a reparations payment, it shouldn't go to individuals. It should be used to improve the protection of and the restoration of the mausoleums.\"\r\nTimbuktu was famed for the reverence it gave to its saints and tourists once came here for spiritual peace.\r\nBut times have changed. Rubbish is now strewn around the mausoleum of Cheikh Sidi Ahmed Ben Amar. Locals use the site as a dump. \r\nThis started after Al Mahdi and his pickaxe-wielding rebels reduced the mausoleum to rubble, but is still continuing today.\r\n\"Today, what grieves me the most is all this rubbish,\" says mausoleum guardian Mohamed Maouloud.\r\nHe adds that he's been to see people, including the Malian army general Ould Meidou and Timbuktu regional council Ould Hamadi, to see if they can fix the problem.\r\nThe sites that were attacked were built during the 15th and 16th centuries at a time when Timbuktu was considered a great centre of Islamic learning. All but one of them was on the World Heritage list.\r\nThe Netherlands based ICC found that Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi had intentionally directed attacks against nine mausoleums and a mosque door in the desert city in 2012. \r\nProsecutors said Al Mahdi was a member of Ansar Dine, an Islamic extremist group with links to al-Qaida which held power in northern Mali at the time. The militants were driven out after nearly a year by French forces, and those troops arrested Al Mahdi in neighbouring Niger in 2014.\r\nThe ICC said the destruction of cultural monuments like those in Timbuktu: \"carries a message of terror and helplessness. (It) destroys part of humanity's shared memory and collective consciousness, and renders humanity unable to transmit its values and knowledge to future generations.\"\r\nAt previous hearings, Al Mahdi pleaded guilty and expressed remorse for his role in leading the destruction, urged Muslims around the world not to commit similar acts and was sentenced to nine years in prison.\r\nAl Boukhari en Essayouti, director of Timbuktu Cultural Mission, says hearing his remorse was \"a relief\".\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/82fa58f3e7fe29360d890a2d8d92fb5f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
