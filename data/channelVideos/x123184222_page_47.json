The company claims that its units can produce 40 per cent more power compared to traditional rooftop solar systems.\r\nWith a sunflower-inspired design, the 194 square-foot (59 square-metre) unit has 12 petals of solar panels attached to a dual-axis tracker. \r\nThis allows the system to take advantage of maximum sun exposure by tracking light rays from sunrise to sunset, a feature that clearly differentiates the Smartflower POP from rooftop panels which absorb light from a fixed angle.\r\nEach unit is programmed to work autonomously after the initial set-up. At the first ray of light the system opens, or rather blooms, to expand its petals for the day.\r\nIt shuts down on its own when it detects that the sun has set and, with soft bristles underneath each petal, it cleans itself in the process. \r\nIn bad weather like heavy rain it detects the wind speed and automatically closes to avoid any damage to the petals. Since it is an all-in-one 'plug and play' system it can also be transported when needed if the owner moves house.\r\nIt generates around 3,400 to 6,200 kWh per year depending on the region. If a client has a higher energy requirement, Smartflower also offers customised units with upgraded electricity production.\r\nThe Philippines' first Smartflower POP unit was installed at De La Salle Lipa (DLSL), an educational institution in a province about an hour away from the capital Manila. \r\nArnold Capuloy, Chief Strategy and Advancement Officer at De La Salle Lipa, says the school wanted to set an example and educate the community about doing their part to save the environment:\r\n\"This one is a conversation piece. By getting their attention it will give us a time for us to share our advocacy, to share with them the reason why we are using this and an appeal actually. It's time for us to make an appeal to them to do the same,\" he says.\r\nBecause of its 'plug-and play' promise, it took just 2 hours to install the Smartflower POP. After it was mounted, exact coordinates for it to track the sun were then inputted.\r\nThe Philippines still heavily depends on fossil fuels for power. Coal generated 48 per cent of the country's power in 2016 according to the Department of Energy. \r\nBut with a National Renewable Energy Programme in place, more efforts are being made to produce greener energy. And companies like Smartflower are now offering Filipinos a wider choice of renewable energy options.\r\nPaul Cabacungan is Head of Operations at the Ateneo Innovation Center, which specialises in designing solar-powered devices to help remote communities have off-the-grid independence.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/beb54f3db7744529a99aef5c44d0e9ec \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

The company claims that its units can produce 40 per cent more power compared to traditional rooftop solar systems.\r\nWith a sunflower-inspired design, the 194 square-foot (59 square-metre) unit has 12 petals of solar panels attached to a dual-axis tracker. \r\nThis allows the system to take advantage of maximum sun exposure by tracking light rays from sunrise to sunset, a feature that clearly differentiates the Smartflower POP from rooftop panels which absorb light from a fixed angle.\r\nEach unit is programmed to work autonomously after the initial set-up. At the first ray of light the system opens, or rather blooms, to expand its petals for the day.\r\nIt shuts down on its own when it detects that the sun has set and, with soft bristles underneath each petal, it cleans itself in the process. \r\nIn bad weather like heavy rain it detects the wind speed and automatically closes to avoid any damage to the petals. Since it is an all-in-one 'plug and play' system it can also be transported when needed if the owner moves house.\r\nIt generates around 3,400 to 6,200 kWh per year depending on the region. If a client has a higher energy requirement, Smartflower also offers customised units with upgraded electricity production.\r\nThe Philippines' first Smartflower POP unit was installed at De La Salle Lipa (DLSL), an educational institution in a province about an hour away from the capital Manila. \r\nArnold Capuloy, Chief Strategy and Advancement Officer at De La Salle Lipa, says the school wanted to set an example and educate the community about doing their part to save the environment:\r\n\"This one is a conversation piece. By getting their attention it will give us a time for us to share our advocacy, to share with them the reason why we are using this and an appeal actually. It's time for us to make an appeal to them to do the same,\" he says.\r\nBecause of its 'plug-and play' promise, it took just 2 hours to install the Smartflower POP. After it was mounted, exact coordinates for it to track the sun were then inputted.\r\nThe Philippines still heavily depends on fossil fuels for power. Coal generated 48 per cent of the country's power in 2016 according to the Department of Energy. \r\nBut with a National Renewable Energy Programme in place, more efforts are being made to produce greener energy.

With her famous headscarf, rosy cheeks and long eye-lashes, the Russian nesting doll is recognised the world over.\r\nFirst made at the beginning of the 19th century the doll, which contains 6 smaller versions of itself, is a much loved child's toy and a popular souvenir.\r\nHandmade, no two Matryoshkas are identical. The word  \"Matryoshka\" is a diminutive of the female name Matrena, which comes from the Latin word matron, meaning \"mother\".\r\n\"Speaking as a whole the Matryoshka is the symbol of motherhood, it is the symbol of womanhood. Truly what today we call the 'Russian Spirit',\" says Alena Shapovalova, an historian from the Art History Museum of Semenov.\r\nThe Semenov Matryoshka doll is probably one of the best known of the dolls. Made by hand in the town of Semenov in the Nizhny Novgorod region it takes at least 7 days to make just one.\r\nIt goes through numerous hands during the process, from making to painting and polishing.\r\nThe painting process alone involves the painstaking work of several painters in three stages, each applying a new layer.\r\n\"The first artist applies the features to the Matryoshka doll, that means she draws the face, the hands, the headscarf, the Sarafan (traditional Russian\/ Slavic attire). The Matryoshka doll ends up looking like this. The next operation is taken up by the covering painter and she begins to cover the Matryoshka doll. Our traditional Matryoshka doll has a yellow headscarf and red Sarafan. Also we have this little pattern here we call the chessboard. It is our traditional trademark. After the Matryoshka doll has been covered and touched up, the next painter takes it up in her hands and begins to paint the flowers. She fills out the apron with flowers, so it looks like the Matryoshka doll is holding a bouquet in her hands and also the edge of the headscarf,\" explains Matryoshka painter Irina Kosterina.\r\nAll the hard work is definitely worth it as they continue to delight and intrigue tourists from all over the world.\r\n\"In the States we don't have them typically, you know,\" explains US tourist Jamie Fishenberry. \"So that is something, at least for Americans, we think of tourists, souvenirs, they are really common, very popular.\"\r\nMeanwhile Indian tourist Panjali Mukhaji says: \"If I am going back to my home I would like to take a Matryoshka from here because it represents Russia traditionally.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5defc5980f45b67c0a1e6c595faf3a2c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
