His lawsuit, filed Tuesday in New York, lays out an explosive tale of Trump allies conspiring to push a false story to take the pressure of the Russian collusion investigation off the president, and a news organization willing to show the president its story before it was published.\r\nFox called the accusation that reporter Malia Zimmerman's story was published to detract from the Russian investigation \"completely erroneous.\" \r\nJay Wallace, Fox's news president, said the story is still being investigated and that Fox has no evidence that Wheeler was misquoted.\r\nThe White House had no immediate comment.\r\nWheeler, a Fox contributor who looked into Rich's July 2016 murder for the family, was brought into the case by Ed Butowsky, a Texas man and Trump supporter who appeared frequently on Fox, the lawsuit said. \r\nButowsky was intent on establishing a link between Rich, who was killed in July 2016 in what Washington police believe was a botched robbery, and the WikiLeaks scandal.\r\nWheeler was quoted in the May 16 story on Fox's web site saying there had been contact between Rich and WikiLeaks, whose dump of DNC emails proved a major detriment to Hillary Clinton's campaign. \r\nHe also said he was quoted falsely saying that someone - possibly Democrats or Clinton campaign officials - was blocking an investigation into Rich's murder.\r\nTwo days before the Fox article was published, Butowsky told Wheeler in a phone conversation that Trump had read the article and wanted it published immediately, the lawsuit said.\r\nButowsky had no immediate comment.\r\nWheeler also claimed that he was told that his false comments were put in the story because Trump wanted it that way. Wheeler also said that he and Butowsky had met with former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and showed Spicer notes on Wheeler's investigation. Spicer asked to be kept informed of the probe, the lawsuit said.\r\nFox removed the story from its website a week after it was published, saying that \"it was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all of our reporting.\" That forced Fox News' most high-profile host, Sean Hannity, to back away from aggressively pushing the story on the air.\r\nWheeler, who is black and has been a Fox contributor since 2005, is also suing Fox for racial discrimination. He said similar law enforcement experts who are white were given higher pay and more opportunities. Wallace denied the accusations.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9ce07b9e95de8979273c827ce93b75c3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Keep putting the weight on and your team mates will be dealt a penalty. \r\nAccording to the organisers, peer pressure and competition is a perfect weight loss combination.\r\nMost of the men who join aim to lose between five and ten per cent of their body fat.\r\nTerry Douding is project manager for ManVFat Football and he says the growth of the league shows they're on to a winning formula.\r\nHe says: \"I mean in the last eighteen months men all around the UK have been able to lose over thirty tons of weight and that is based on men losing one to two stone per season. Most of the men are loosing five per cent and many of them are losing ten per cent of their starting body weight and a lot of that comes down to the peer support from the other men and the coach. You know many of these men won't even be looking for new advice around nutrition, many of the men know what to do, but they need that accountability for change and turning up to a weekly weigh in with nineteen mates looking over their shoulder, knowing that it's the difference between winning, or losing the season, is usually enough for many of the men.\"\r\nWhen players join they fill in a detailed questionnaire which inquires about their goals and where they have failed in the past. \r\nDowding says: \"On week fourteen, from week nine in fact, we would begin encouraging clients to fill those surveys back in with those gradings we can get an idea of individuals's self improvement and in fact on the first pilot league, the first league that we piloted,  98 per cent of the league reported health improvements of some sort.\"\r\nEach team has a coach who will take details about their weight, health and diet before every match. The aim is for the men to play at least two matches each week. \r\nOrganisers say they already have sponsorship and support from some professional football teams.\r\nThe men who play here are supported by Leyton Orient a professional club based in east London.\r\nThe club ground is literally across the field.\r\nMan V Fat says the cost of joining is about twenty-five British pounds each month, which is on par with the cost of gym membership. \r\nIn some parts of the country membership is free, as the scheme is incorporated into facilities provided by local health authorities.\r\nMember Dave Worley says he's always had problems with his weight and when he left university and started working he had even less time to do exercise. \r\nMost of the men who come here say they enjoy football, but their weight makes it difficult to play in other leagues.\r\nPhilip Smith is the head of health and well being at the Leyton Orient Trust.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3cf2fd058bfc3c95c1db6cf7a168193f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Wide of White Walker figure outside at Walt Disney Concert Hall, site of season 7 premiere of \"Game of Thrones\"\r\n2. SOUNDBITE (English) John Bradley, actor:\r\n\"It's hard to say goodbye because you have a double whammy of grief, because when characters die in the show, you are saying goodbye to characters that you love as a fan of the show and you're saying goodbye to actors you worked with as well. I'm clinging onto every single second that I got left being in 'Game of Thrones.' I don't really want to think about the end. Don't want to think about it.\"\r\n3. Tilt down Iain Glen wearing kilt\r\n4. SOUNDBITE (English) Iain Glen, actor:\r\n\"Now, we're a very tight, very bonded unit. So I think there will be a real sense of loss when it all concludes, when it all goes away. So maybe people are just preparing themselves for that sadness. I know I'll feel a huge void. And again, it's sort of unusual as an actor. You get used to ducking and diving, not knowing what's coming next - or maybe knowing one thing up ahead. But to know that something is coming around, each year, that you love doing, that is a huge hit, you've got to cherish it while it's there. Because you know, it won't be.\"\r\n5. Wide of Jerome Flynn talking to reporter\r\n6. SOUNDBITE (English) Jerome Flynn, actor:\r\n\"Each season that comes along, it feels kind of like a gift - like a Christmas gift to me. So we don't know from one season to the next what's going to happen. So I'm just kind of taking it and trying not to miss it before it's gone. Just to kind of savor the extraordinary nature of the job. There is definitely not another one like this that will come along for me. So just enjoying it while it's here.\"\r\n7. Wide Isaac Hempstead Wright talks with reporter\r\n8. SOUNDBITE (English) Isaac Hempstead Wright, Actor:\r\n\"I don't want to think about it yet. I haven't said any goodbyes. I'm going, I'll see you next season. I'll see you next season. Maybe not the one after that, but definitely next season.\"\r\n9. Wide of Nathalie Emmanuel talking to reporter\r\n10. SOUNDBITE (English) Nathalie Emmanuel, actress: \"I think saying goodbye will be difficult when it happens. It will be weird not going back to film, at whatever point, you know. But I think we'll probably just say it as it happens. I don't know if there's any... I haven't really had - allowed myself to say goodbye yet, because it's not goodbye just yet. And I hope we all stay in touch.\"\r\n11 .

                "description": "(3 Aug 2017) \r\nASSOCIATED PRESS\r\nLos Angeles, 12 July 2017\r\n1. Wide of White Walker figure outside at Walt Disney Concert Hall, site of season 7 premiere of \"Game of Thrones\"\r\n2. SOUNDBITE (English) John Bradley, actor:\r\n\"It's hard to say goodbye because you have a double whammy of grief, because when characters die in the show, you are saying goodbye to characters that you love as a fan of the show and you're saying goodbye to actors you worked with as well. I'm clinging onto every single second that I got left being in 'Game of Thrones.' I don't really want to think about the end. Don't want to think about it.\"\r\n3. Tilt down Iain Glen wearing kilt\r\n4. SOUNDBITE (English) Iain Glen, actor:\r\n\"Now, we're a very tight, very bonded unit. So I think there will be a real sense of loss when it all concludes, when it all goes away. So maybe people are just preparing themselves for that sadness. I know I'll feel a huge void. And again, it's sort of unusual as an actor. You get used to ducking and diving, not knowing what's coming next - or maybe knowing one thing up ahead. But to know that something is coming around, each year, that you love doing, that is a huge hit, you've got to cherish it while it's there. Because you know, it won't be.\"\r\n5. Wide of Jerome Flynn talking to reporter\r\n6. SOUNDBITE (English) Jerome Flynn, actor:\r\n\"Each season that comes along, it feels kind of like a gift - like a Christmas gift to me. So we don't know from one season to the next what's going to happen. So I'm just kind of taking it and trying not to miss it before it's gone. Just to kind of savor the extraordinary nature of the job. There is definitely not another one like this that will come along for me. So just enjoying it while it's here.\"\r\n7. Wide Isaac Hempstead Wright talks with reporter\r\n8. SOUNDBITE (English) Isaac Hempstead Wright, Actor:\r\n\"I don't want to think about it yet. I haven't said any goodbyes. I'm going, I'll see you next season. I'll see you next season. Maybe not the one after that, but definitely next season.\"\r\n9. Wide of Nathalie Emmanuel talking to reporter\r\n10. SOUNDBITE (English) Nathalie Emmanuel, actress: \"I think saying goodbye will be difficult when it happens. It will be weird not going back to film, at whatever point, you know. But I think we'll probably just say it as it happens. I don't know if there's any... I haven't really had - allowed myself to say goodbye yet, because it's not goodbye just yet. And I hope we all stay in touch.\"\r\n11 .

            "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Trinkets, statues and jewelry crafted from the tusks of at least 100 slaughtered elephants were fed Thursday into a rock crusher in Central Park to demonstrate the state's commitment to smashing the illegal ivory trade.\r\nThe artifacts placed ceremoniously onto a conveyor belt to be ground into dust included piles of golf-ball-sized Japanese sculptures, called netsuke, intricately carved into monkeys, rabbits and other fanciful designs. Many of the items were beautiful. Some were extremely valuable.\r\nBut state environmental officials and Wildlife Conservation Society members, who partnered with Tiffany &amp; Co. for the \"Ivory Crush\" of nearly 2 tons (1.8 metric tons) of ivory, said no price justifies slaughtering elephants for their tusks.\r\nThe sale of ivory across international boundaries has been banned since 1990, but the U.S. and many other countries have allowed people to buy and sell ivory domestically, subject to certain regulations that gave smugglers loopholes. Last year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service instituted a near-total ban on the domestic commercial ivory trade and barred sales across state lines.\r\nSince August 2014, New York law has prohibited the sale, purchase, trade or distribution of anything made from elephant or mammoth ivory or rhinoceros horn, except in limited situations with state approval. Enforcement efforts have focused on New York City, the nation's largest port of entry for illegal wildlife goods, state officials said.\r\nThe ivory pieces sent to the crusher included more than $4.5 million worth seized by undercover investigators from Metropolitan Fine Arts &amp; Antiques in New York City in 2015. In pleading guilty last week to illegally selling ivory, the store's owners agreed to donate $100,000 each to the World Wildlife Fund and Wild Tomorrow Fund for their endangered species protection projects.\r\nMore than 270 tons (245 metric tons) of ivory have been destroyed by governments and conservation groups in high-profile public events in 22 countries, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society.\r\nSome critics have argued that destroying ivory could drive up black market prices by increasing scarcity, thus encouraging more poaching. Others argue that it's wasteful and that it would be better to sell confiscated ivory to pay for conservation efforts in poor African countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9bde7f2dc10dd5fae62ce4ff559630de \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
