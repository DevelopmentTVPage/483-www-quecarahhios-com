                "description": "(5 Oct 2017) The mayor of Barcelona has called on the EU to take an active role in facilitating dialogue between the Spanish and Catalan governments.\r\nSpeaking on Thursday, Ada Colau said a \"forum for dialogue\" needed to be formed, but that it was only possible to do so with European involvement.\r\nShe called for European institutions to consider setting up a task force of experts to mediate in the political deadlock between the regional and national governments.\r\nColau earlier met with consular representatives of European countries and shared with them the need for a \"task force under the European umbrella\" to facilitate a dialogue, with the help of academics, jurists and regional lawmakers of all parties.\r\nOfficials in the European Union have called for dialogue, but have supported Spain's conservative government in blaming the political crisis on Catalonia's regional government.\r\nThe ruling Catalan coalition and other separatist politicians have declared valid the results of a referendum on 1 October that was held amid police violence and against a Constitutional Court suspension.\r\nEU officials have also said that Catalan government's bid for independence is an internal Spanish affair.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/2d290960c3d53dc353a976d044e6871b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

And that's of course what AAA recommends to do even if the technology is available to you to do it while driving.\" \r\nProgramming a destination into an in-vehicle GPS navigation system was the most distracting activity, taking drivers an average of 40 seconds to complete the task. \r\nAt 25 mph (40 kph), a car can travel the length of four football fields during the time it takes to enter a destination. \r\nPrevious research has shown that drivers who remove their eyes from the road for just two seconds double their risk for a crash.\r\nNelson says drivers testing all 30 of the 2017 model year cars and light trucks took their eyes off the road, and hands off the wheel, while using infotainment systems. \r\n\"One thing that was really surprising to me was that of all the systems that we evaluated 30 in this round. None of them allowed drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road for the duration of completing a particular task like tuning the radio that at some point in every process the driver is required to manually interact with the vehicle dashboard which usually comes with glances away from the roadway,\" says Nelson.\r\nThe test drivers used voice commands, touch screens and other interactive technologies to make calls, send texts, tune the radio or program navigation all while driving.\r\n\"We want drivers keep their hands on the wheel. We want drivers to keep their eyes on the road and we shouldn't provide vehicle controls and technologies in cars that could potentially encourage drivers to do just the opposite,\" says Nelson.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/78ea396d1e3da8cc21538c1d6205fe04 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
