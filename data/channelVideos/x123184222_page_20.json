For me, the damage done was beyond the moral, it wasn't really just material.\"\r\nHe adds: \"I believe that even if there is a reparations payment, it shouldn't go to individuals.

All but one of them was on the World Heritage list.\r\nThe Netherlands based ICC found that Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi had intentionally directed attacks against nine mausoleums and a mosque door in the desert city in 2012. \r\nProsecutors said Al Mahdi was a member of Ansar Dine, an Islamic extremist group with links to al-Qaida which held power in northern Mali at the time. The militants were driven out after nearly a year by French forces, and those troops arrested Al Mahdi in neighbouring Niger in 2014.\r\nThe ICC said the destruction of cultural monuments like those in Timbuktu: \"carries a message of terror and helplessness. (It) destroys part of humanity's shared memory and collective consciousness, and renders humanity unable to transmit its values and knowledge to future generations.\"\r\nAt previous hearings, Al Mahdi pleaded guilty and expressed remorse for his role in leading the destruction, urged Muslims around the world not to commit similar acts and was sentenced to nine years in prison.\r\nAl Boukhari en Essayouti, director of Timbuktu Cultural Mission, says hearing his remorse was \"a relief\".\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/82fa58f3e7fe29360d890a2d8d92fb5f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
