The silhouette is loose and feminine, with short skirts featuring leg-revealing tulip hemlines, sheer organza pantsuits with an easy cut and casual apron dress with abstract florals.\r\nThe designer often layered florals and prints over dark underlays - perhaps a message to see the brighter side of things. At other times he placed a sheer layer over prints, creating a smoky effect. Silken printed skirts opened over a black dress, or a long, draping foulard tucked across the front of a cocktail dress. The prints were inspired by painters, the designer won't say whom.\r\nThe primary color combinations for daywear are red and purple with black accents, segueing into grays for formal suits and black for evening.\r\nDespite the designer's intentions, long black veils over cocktail dresses had a funereal feel, and somehow the pompoms bouncing on scarves and bedecking caps failed to provide levity.

You know, and I think that there's a lot of probably awkward high school students out there that have kind of X'd themselves out.  You know, it's an awkward phase in life.  You know that,\" Davis said.  \"You don't feel like you're pretty enough, good enough, smart enough \u2013 nothing is enough.  He taught me that I was enough.  He listened to me, you know?  That was the best education he gave me.\"\r\nBello, known for her role in \"A History of Violence,\" remembered a ninth-grade political science teacher who helped her find her sense of social justice. \r\n\"She put me on my path to civil rights and social justice, and I'll never forget her,\" Bello said.  \"I read Elie Wiesel's 'Night' - 'Night' - for the first time, and learned about the Holocaust, and it hit me so deeply.  I realized I had to do everything in my power to stand up for people in general.\"\r\nFormer Nickelodeon star Miranda Cosgrove had fond memories of both her long-time home-schooling teacher and her kindergarten teacher, Miss Sapia.\r\n\"She did all sorts of art projects in her room and I actually remember for Halloween, like, she would have everybody paint a witch in class, and I was, like, so excited to do that.  And then also I have another teacher named Patty Foy, that I had all through high school, when I did home-schooling, and she's amazing,\" Cosgrove said. \r\nThe 24-year-old actress and singer says Foy taught her to pursue her passions. \r\n\"She always encouraged me to try different things and to actually go with what I was inspired to do.  Like, I love art and a lot of classes that I wasn't actually taking in school,\" she said.  \"I love photography.

                "description": "(22 Sep 2017) VIOLA DAVIS' BEST TEACHER 'TAUGHT ME THAT I WAS ENOUGH' \r\nViola Davis says her best-ever teacher gave her a sense of confidence. \r\n\"He taught me that I was enough,\" the Oscar-winning actress says of her Upward Bound teacher Jeff Kenyon.\r\nDavis, Miranda Cosgrove and Maria Bello remembered their top teachers at a recent education-focused event in Santa Monica, California. \r\n52-year-old Davis, who is currently starring in the series \"How to Get Away With Murder,\" grew up poor in Rhode Island, and has long credited the government-sponsored Upward Bound program with helping her prepare for higher education.\r\n\"The best thing he told me is that I'm important.  You know, and I think that there's a lot of probably awkward high school students out there that have kind of X'd themselves out.  You know, it's an awkward phase in life.  You know that,\" Davis said.  \"You don't feel like you're pretty enough, good enough, smart enough \u2013 nothing is enough.  He taught me that I was enough.  He listened to me, you know?  That was the best education he gave me.\"\r\nBello, known for her role in \"A History of Violence,\" remembered a ninth-grade political science teacher who helped her find her sense of social justice. \r\n\"She put me on my path to civil rights and social justice, and I'll never forget her,\" Bello said.  \"I read Elie Wiesel's 'Night' - 'Night' - for the first time, and learned about the Holocaust, and it hit me so deeply.  I realized I had to do everything in my power to stand up for people in general.\"\r\nFormer Nickelodeon star Miranda Cosgrove had fond memories of both her long-time home-schooling teacher and her kindergarten teacher, Miss Sapia.\r\n\"She did all sorts of art projects in her room and I actually remember for Halloween, like, she would have everybody paint a witch in class, and I was, like, so excited to do that.  And then also I have another teacher named Patty Foy, that I had all through high school, when I did home-schooling, and she's amazing,\" Cosgrove said. \r\nThe 24-year-old actress and singer says Foy taught her to pursue her passions. \r\n\"She always encouraged me to try different things and to actually go with what I was inspired to do.

            "description": "(25 Sep 2017) LEADIN: \r\nNot content with supplementing our own diets with vitamins and probiotics, we are now turning our concerns about gut health onto our pets.\r\nManufacturers of probiotic supplements for dogs and cats say sales are booming.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nIn California pets are getting used to something a little different in their food bowl.\r\nGrooming and wellbeing is no longer confined to a visit to the pet parlour, animal lovers are ensuring their pooches and pussycats get an internal makeover too. \r\nThe aim is to use probiotics to build a healthy intestinal flora and strengthen immune systems.\r\nThey're being widely prescribed by vets and more pet stores throughout Los Angeles are carrying several varieties of the products. \r\nThis is despite the fact there has been no clinical research that probiotics improve colon health in cat and dogs.\r\nProbiotics are now available in a variety of forms for pets, from powders to mix, capsules to add, chews to bite, or frozen for use at a later date.\r\nMany veterinarians in Los Angeles say there must be a balance for digestive and overall wellness, just as in humans.\r\nWith probiotics, the good bacteria go to the lower part of the digestive track and are supposed to ferment, while fighting off the bad bacteria.\r\nDr. Jeff Werber, President and Chief Veterinarian of LA's Century Veterinary Group argues probiotics are beneficial to a dog or cats overall health and help settle an upset stomach.\r\n\"Probiotics are beneficial to the gut flora. They seem to balance the bacteria in the gut and there are so many things that animals do and animals eat - medications that we as veterinarians give these patients that could upset that balance, inflammatory conditions, inflammatory bowel disease for example, any time of infiltrative disease can also affect the gut flora and upset that balance and therefore we see problems like diarrhoea\" says Werber.\r\nAt Pussy &amp; Pooch Pet Lifestyle Center in Beverly Hills, pet nutrition is part of the overall package of wellness, retail, grooming, day care, training and boarding services.\r\nCompany founder Janene Zakrajsek says: \"I think when it comes to probiotics anything that is considered a functional product i.e. functional treats. is a lot easier for consumers to wrap their heads around because it's a lot easier so they are not necessarily thinking it as an alternative to medicine, they're thinking it as something natural that they can do as a supplement, but by packaging it as something functional where it's combined with a treat or a chewable tablet or like a frozen yogurt or a goat milk these are ways of incorporating something that is healthy and beneficial in an easy way.\"\r\nStaff here curate their own probiotics.\r\nHollywood's Healthy Spot, an organic pet food and dog day care centre has pet probiotics on many of its shelves.\r\nHere, employees also see daily probiotic preparation no longer a problem.\r\nIts spokesperson Jade Lorain says there are too many processed pet foods marketing themselves as being healthy, but she believes the best foods are raw or mixed on the spot.\r\n\"The probiotics keep the bad bacteria from taking over their pets digestive system along with the enzymes that breakdown the food. We carry different products such as raw goats milk that have all 30 enzymes needed for digestive systems that you just defrost and pour into their daily routine with their food, along with tripe toppers that are little treats that you add into the food that are filled with probiotics and enzymes,\" says Lorain.\r\nHowever, Dr. Werber says not all probiotics are the same.\r\nHe believes some products which carry health claims on their label are adding substandard probiotics to their pet food lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8ba75866829dbc5268231c915fe2a0f9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
