            "description": "(3 Aug 2017) In terse exchanges with audience members and the press, Corey Lewandowski, President Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, repeated skirted questions surrounding his consulting and financial activities. \r\nLewandowski came to Ohio on Thursday for a speech to the City Club in Cleveland and a fundraiser for a Republican congressman, Jim Renacci, who's a gubernatorial candidate with ties to Trump. \"I would love to see Jim become governor of Ohio,\u201d he said.\r\nBut it's Lewandowski's relationship with a payday lender in Ohio that attracted the most attention. \r\nThe Associated Press reviewed a draft contract between his new firm and Community Choice Financial, which shows the company wanted to pay his firm $20,000 a month for advice. Lewandowski said the contract was \"never executed.\" The lender has been a leader in the industry's battles against government regulation, and in particular against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\r\nAt his City Club appearance, an audience member demanded that Lewandowski say \"yes or no\" whether Community Choice Financial is employing him.\r\nInstead of answering, Lewandowski said he doesn't \"make one dime\" tied to Cordray losing a job. The nonresponse left audience members groaning. Later, he told reporters that Community Choice isn't currently a client, though he said he gives \"free advice, all the time,\" to lots of people. He declined to name any of his clients.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/0d76a8762042e83e4416e4571dd78a5c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Former rap mogul Marion \"Suge\" Knight pleaded not guilty Thursday to allegations that he threatened to kill or seriously injure the director of the film \"Straight Outta Compton.\"\r\nThe Death Row Records co-founder appeared in court in Los Angeles after being indicted on criminal threat charges stemming from an August 2014 incident when Knight allegedly threatened the film's director, F. Gary Gray.\r\nThe 2015 biopic focused on the rise and fall of the hip hop group N.W.A. and Knight is depicted in the film as an influential figure in the rap movement in Compton in the late '80s and '90s. One of the group's members, Dr. Dre, left N.W.A. after he hired Knight as his manager.\r\nThe two later founded Death Row Records, which fueled gangster rap's popularity in the 1990s and its roster included Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg. Knight lost control of the company after it was forced into bankruptcy.\r\nKnight's attorney, Matthew Fletcher, told reporters that his client had been in negotiations with Gray and was seeking compensation for the use of his likeness in the film.\r\nThe indictment against Knight alleges he made specific threats against Gray that conveyed \"an immediate prospect of execution,\" leading Gray to fear for his life and the safety of his family. Fletcher said Knight denies threatening Gray.\r\nKnight remains jailed and is awaiting trial on an unrelated murder charge filed after a 2015 incident in which he ran over two men outside a Compton burger stand, killing one. His lawyers have said he was fleeing armed attackers when he struck the men.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5eea75e098473751bfa66a2d2d99bd06 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
