                "description": "(29 Sep 2017) A stampede broke out on a crowded pedestrian bridge connecting two railway stations in Mumbai during the Friday morning rush, killing at least 22 people and injuring another 27, officials said.\r\nPolice were investigating what caused the stampede on the bridge's raised staircase, causing some commuters to leap over the railing. \r\nOthers were crushed or fell underfoot and were trampled.\r\nOne rescuer told Indian broadcaster NDTV that the stampede left dozens trapped in the narrow passage, forcing rescuers to break the railing to pull people out.\r\nMumbai police official Gansham Patel said that when falling concrete hit a part of the bridge railing, people in the crowd panicked at the thought the ceiling was collapsing and surged forward to escape.\r\nCommuters also often complain about street-sellers hawking their wares on the narrow overpass, which connects two commuter railway stations - Elphinstone and Parel.\r\nHeavy rains meant the bridge was even more crowded than usual, as some sought shelter from the downpour under the canopy covering the bridge, said lawmaker Shaina Nana Chudasama of the governing Bhartiya Janata Party.\r\nAs Mumbai police appealed to citizens to donate blood to help the injured, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences to the families of those killed.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/05beaa67f2af751f95959175ce561095 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(29 Sep 2017) LEAD IN:\r\nA former stuntman owns one of Egypt's most impressive classic car collections.\r\nSayed Cima has vehicles built more than 100 years ago and rents them out exclusively to the film and TV industry.\r\n\r\nSTORY-LINE:\r\nA little slice of automotive history. \r\nThis 1948 silver Ford is one of around 45 classic cars stored in a garage in western Giza.\r\nThe very oldest is an American 1903 Auburn.\r\nAnd eagle-eyed film fans might even recognise some from the screen.\r\nThey are rented out only for cinematic and TV projects.\r\nThe treasure trove of vintage vehicles has been built up over 47 years by a former stuntman.\r\nSayed Cima's experience in the film industry inspired him to create this business - but the cars were not always in high demand.\r\n\"Long ago no one would rent a vintage car for cinematic shooting. Every actor at that time had his own car and used it in his movies. I was the first person who suggested collecting these cars and allowing rentals to film and drama shoots,\" he says. \r\n\"I had little work to do. I worked every five or six years in one dramatic project only. After my vehicles began appearing on the screen, authors began writing old dramatic stories. And then my work increased and I began working on two and three projects at the same time.\"\r\nRoyal carriages and replica carts are also amongst his collection.\r\nThey have appeared in historical TV series such as Abdeen's Palace, Halawany's Gate and King Farouk.\r\nCima often buys vehicles in a state of disrepair and spends time refurbishing and repairing them before they are ready to be hired out to the film industry.\r\nHe has a parking lot elsewhere stuffed with vintage car bodies waiting to be rebuilt.\r\nTV directors usually visit this garage to browse the vehicles on display and pick out the most appropriate ones for their shoot.\r\nBut Cima's job is not finished when he delivers the cars to the film set.\r\nHe also has to make sure the actors can operate the aging machines - and there is an ingenious solution if they can't.\r\n\"Some actors don't know how to drive them. They are afraid of using them. Other actors don't know how to drive in general, neither old cars nor new ones,\" he says. \r\n\"If there is a scene that includes an actor driving a vintage car, two or three workers hide behind it and start pushing the car while shooting the scene in front of the camera.\"\r\nThe crowning jewel in Cima's collection has an illustrious previous owner.\r\nThis 1974 Chevrolet Impala belonged to the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. \r\nA similar vehicle was used in the film 'Days of Sadat', but that was a replica.\r\n\"I wish that it had appeared in the famous film, but unfortunately it didn't.

                "description": "(29 Sep 2017) LEAD IN:\r\nA former stuntman owns one of Egypt's most impressive classic car collections.\r\nSayed Cima has vehicles built more than 100 years ago and rents them out exclusively to the film and TV industry.\r\n\r\nSTORY-LINE:\r\nA little slice of automotive history. \r\nThis 1948 silver Ford is one of around 45 classic cars stored in a garage in western Giza.\r\nThe very oldest is an American 1903 Auburn.\r\nAnd eagle-eyed film fans might even recognise some from the screen.\r\nThey are rented out only for cinematic and TV projects.\r\nThe treasure trove of vintage vehicles has been built up over 47 years by a former stuntman.\r\nSayed Cima's experience in the film industry inspired him to create this business - but the cars were not always in high demand.\r\n\"Long ago no one would rent a vintage car for cinematic shooting. Every actor at that time had his own car and used it in his movies. I was the first person who suggested collecting these cars and allowing rentals to film and drama shoots,\" he says. \r\n\"I had little work to do. I worked every five or six years in one dramatic project only. After my vehicles began appearing on the screen, authors began writing old dramatic stories. And then my work increased and I began working on two and three projects at the same time.\"\r\nRoyal carriages and replica carts are also amongst his collection.\r\nThey have appeared in historical TV series such as Abdeen's Palace, Halawany's Gate and King Farouk.\r\nCima often buys vehicles in a state of disrepair and spends time refurbishing and repairing them before they are ready to be hired out to the film industry.\r\nHe has a parking lot elsewhere stuffed with vintage car bodies waiting to be rebuilt.\r\nTV directors usually visit this garage to browse the vehicles on display and pick out the most appropriate ones for their shoot.\r\nBut Cima's job is not finished when he delivers the cars to the film set.\r\nHe also has to make sure the actors can operate the aging machines - and there is an ingenious solution if they can't.\r\n\"Some actors don't know how to drive them. They are afraid of using them. Other actors don't know how to drive in general, neither old cars nor new ones,\" he says. \r\n\"If there is a scene that includes an actor driving a vintage car, two or three workers hide behind it and start pushing the car while shooting the scene in front of the camera.\"\r\nThe crowning jewel in Cima's collection has an illustrious previous owner.\r\nThis 1974 Chevrolet Impala belonged to the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. \r\nA similar vehicle was used in the film 'Days of Sadat', but that was a replica.\r\n\"I wish that it had appeared in the famous film, but unfortunately it didn't.
