Keep in mind that Mozart is a procedure to help the vines to get more protection and grow healthier \" Cignozzi says. \r\nMontalcino is a stronghold of traditional winemaking. Federico Ricci, an agronomist and oenologist at Il Paradiso di Frassina, says  \"The procedure to use music in the vineyard was seen with a lot of scepticism in Montalcino, some smiled or made jokes at Carlo Cignozzi\u2026after years, they changed their minds\".\r\nMarco Pierucci is a freelance agronomist and oenologist. He hasn't worked with Cignozzi but he agrees that the use of vibrations and frequencies in agriculture might favourably influence crops.\r\n \"All the sounds produced by living creature are finely tuned, it's not possible for a human being emit a sound without all the harmonic frequencies, we produce proper chords even if we try to pronounce a single frequency. This is true even for animal life. Even in the life of parasites the are frequencies, and if we interfere with this frequencies, we can facilitate or disadvantage the life of this living creatures. Facilitate the vines and disadvantage the parasites.\" \r\n\"Al Paradiso di Frassina\" is a very small enterprise, less than ten acres of Brunello vines in Montalcino. \r\nMore than 50% of the production is sold in United States, the rest is destined for Northern European markets and some eastern countries like Poland and Ukraine. \r\nPreliminary conclusions from the University research team say that during their study in 2006 variations in growth were observed and total leaf area per vines was increased in the the sound treated vines, which also showed signs of more efficient leaf gas exchange. \r\nBut the scientists note that further studies are needed before any conclusions are drawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/542ca726313cebc7d93a814b60db0373 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
