                "description": "(26 Sep 2017) Warnings that a volcano on the Indonesian tourist island of Bali will erupt have sparked an exodus of more than 75,000 people that is likely to continue to swell, the country's disaster agency said on Tuesday.\r\nPresident Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo visited a sports centre serving as temporary accommodation in a district south of the volcano. \r\nIn a televised news conference, he said the highest priority was \"the safety of our people\" and urged those around Mount Agung to follow the instructions of authorities.\r\nAuthorities have ordered the evacuation of villagers living within a high danger zone that in places extends 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) from Mount Agung's crater. \r\nBut people further away are also leaving, according to a spokesman from the National Disaster Mitigation.\r\nThe region is being rattled daily by hundreds of tremors from the mountain, which volcanologists say indicates a high chance of an eruption. \r\nMount Agung last erupted in 1963, killing about 1,100 people.\r\nEvacuees are taking shelter at more than 370 sites across the island that include temporary camps, sport centres, village halls and the houses of friends and relatives.\r\nIndonesia, an archipelago of thousands of islands, is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/06a4bd6611743168813c5d924a2e78cb \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(26 Sep 2017) President Donald Trump says he'll visit hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico next Tuesday.\r\nTrump announced the visit after the administration came under criticism for its response to the damage on the island that is home to more than 3 million U.S. citizens. The island has been coping with shortages of food, drinking water, electricity and various forms of communication after Hurricane Maria struck earlier this month.\r\nTrump said Tuesday is the earliest he can visit without disrupting recovery operations.\r\nHe says he may also visit the U.S. Virgin Islands.\r\nTrump says Puerto Rico is important to him. He says Puerto Ricans are \"great people and we need to help them.\"\r\nMeeting with members of the House Ways and Means committee, the president also said the new tax plan is all about simplification.\r\nThe plan is to be unveiled on Wednesday.\r\nTrump also said he is disappointed in the several Republican Senators who have announced they will vote against the current repeal and replace bill for the Affordable Care Act.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cac84910c72a83109a2f4bfbd02da63f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
