    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) LEAD IN :\r\nJapanese artist Takashi Murakami has brought his vivid take on the culture clash between East and West to Moscow this week, in a major retrospective of his work spanning the past two decades, the first show of this scale in Russia.\r\n\r\nSTORY-LINE: \r\nMoscow's contemporary art gallery 'Garage',  founded by Russian businessman Roman Abramovich and his ex-wife Daria Zhukova, kicked off its new exhibition season with an  exhibit by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami,  which brought an explosion of color to gallery's minimalist interior.\r\nTrained as a classical artist, Murakami channels the 'flatness' of image in Japanese traditional painting into his own contemporary sensibility. \r\nOut of the contradictions he sees between his own tradition and the excessive world of pop art he sees in the modern world, Murakami has fashioned what he calls his own 'superflat' aesthetic. \r\nThe contrast between the superficial appeal of popular culture  and the reality of life in Japan forms his artistic view, says Murakami, which encompasses the social trauma felt by post-war Japanese society.\r\n\" Japanese culture looks like ringing (sweet sounds) and cuteness and you know  - 'poppy'. But my feeling is not 'pop' because, you know, after World War II, we lost the war and (had) a poor society and social situation, we had to look for some healing, such as comics and animation stuff. - it looks like (it's) healing the heart (but) we have a big, big scar,\" says Murakami. \r\nIn the \"Little Boy and Fat Man\" section of the exhibition,  Murakami explores how the national experience of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki affected culture in Japan. In part, he suggests extreme nature of this experience led to Japan's search for escapism, in the unreal forms of anime and manga, which feature in Murakami's work.\r\nMore recent disasters like the earthquake and tsunami of 2011 fuel yet further what Murakami sees as Japanese culture's need for an escape into the realms of fantasy. \r\nHis work plays with the childlike aesthetics of characters like Pokemon and Hello Kitty which, with Japan's underlying sense of foreboding and tragedy formed by recent history, can never be as sweet as they seem on the surface.\r\nGarage is showing more than eighty paintings, drawings and films produced by Murakami over 20 years and it is the breadth of this work which conveys the depth of his practice, according to the gallery's Chief Curator Ekaterina Nezamstkaya. \r\nShe chose to display some of his earliest anime and manga \u2013 themed works from the early 1990s to show the amount of time Murakami has devoted to and the seriousness with which he examines these forms of popular culture.\r\nIt shows \"... his practice is much more profound than a lot of people think. For us it was important.\" explains Nezamstkaya. \r\n'Under the Radiation Falls' is the title of the show which breaks down into  four major sections, each displaying aspects of Murakami's work. \r\nOne section recreates the work going on in Murakami's 'factory'  - his own studio back in Japan -  in another section Murakami's colorful graphic designs are repeated on walls and floors, while bright plastic and fabric creatures invade other parts of the whole exhibition space.\r\nIt took a lot of negotiation and tough logistical decisions to bring the works to a Moscow audience, says Valentina Sokina, Manager of Exhibition Projects at Garage.\r\n\" The exhibition turned out so interesting and so saturated because two very different teams with from very different cultures met each other halfway\", adds Sorokina, noting the process was somewhat like the culture clash in Murakami's own work.\r\nIt was a bit like the culture clash in Murakami's own work, concludes Sokina. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/35c197c15902e68d3291163affb6e786 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
