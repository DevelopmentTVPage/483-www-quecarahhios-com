    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) Tens of thousands of young immigrants have reapplied for the program protecting them from deportation, hoping this renewal won't be the last time they're able to stay in the country they've called home since childhood. \r\nMore than 112,000 renewals for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program, or DACA, had been sent to federal government as of Wednesday, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Thursday was the deadline for the 154,000 recipients eligible to reapply.\r\nThe rush of paperwork was prompted by the Trump's Administration's announcement in September that DACA would be phased out in March. Until then, the Trump Administration said Congress needed to address the issue of immigrants who were brought to this country by their parents as children. DACA was created by President Barack Obama in 2012 and nearly 700,000 immigrants were under the program.\r\n\"DACA has given so many opportunities for me and many of my other family members, to give us new jobs, a new shot at life,\" said Perla Montoya, who filled out her renewal application on Monday. \"\"Being a single mom with a four year old that has autism is really hard. Knowing that it could be the end of this for me, leaving my autistic child behind is really hard. It's really hard, watching the news, all my dreams coming down hill.\"\r\nAround the country immigrant advocacy organizations and legal aid offices deployed volunteers to help DACA recipients fill out their forms. In Washington state, an anonymous donor donated $125,000 to cover the $495 DACA renewal fee. \r\nBut under Trump's administration arrests of immigrants illegally in the country have increased, including those without criminal records and even some DACA recipients. The renewal process hasn't been without trepidation. \r\n \"I think one of the questions people have is 'should I be providing my address?'\" said Jorge Baron, executive director at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. \"Our advice is that we can't guarantee that information won't be used against them in the future. But on balance, if they don't have the risk factors, like criminal history or prior deportation orders, we think it's more of a benefit to move forward with the renewal than not.\"\r\nBeyond initial rumors of negotiations between Democrats and President Trump, Republican leadership in Congress has not signaled they will move forward with a fix. Meanwhile, young immigrants, often called Dreamers, have begun lobbying lawmakers to pass a bill, one that would not include more money for immigration enforcement.\r\nFor Montoya, she hopes to hear back soon on her renewal. Her DACA expires in December and she doesn't want to leave her job at Nordstrom's.    \r\n\"I woke up this morning with mixed emotions, not knowing if my application will go okay, will everything be okay? Just hoping that I'll get approved,\" Montoya said the day she filled out her application. \"Tons of mixed emotions, but overall very nervous because Homeland Security has our information.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/742bd7bf23c9f18731272e86417ac702 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
