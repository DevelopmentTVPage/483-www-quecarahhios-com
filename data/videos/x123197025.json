    "description": "(24 Jul 2017) LEADIN:\r\nFashion is looking East for inspiration at the Pure London trade show. \r\nEastern-inspired fabrics and styles are tipped to be on trend for Spring\/Summer 2018.  \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nDesigns with an Eastern flair are hitting the catwalk at one of London's top fashion events.\r\nThe Pure London trade show gives retailers and buyers the chance to see what's hot a year before it appears on the high street.\r\nThis show is looking ahead to Spring\/Summer 2018.\r\nThese models are all wearing outfits with Eastern-inspired designs.\r\nThe theme for this show is 'Oriental Futures'. \r\nBut there's more to Eastern design than Chinese lanterns, silk and conical hats.\r\nSara Maggioni is a retail and buying director at the London-based international trend forecasting company WGSN. \r\nShe believes Eastern-inspired fashion is likely to be part of a wider trend involving themes of kinship, versatility and blurring of traditional style categories. \r\n\"Eastern inspired design is a key influence as well for Spring\/Summer '18. Again it taps into the concept of kinship and the concept of cultures influencing one another but in terms of the actual look of the garment, if we think about Qipao, Chinese Qipao dresses, if we think about the frogging, the details on the dress, if we think about silk becoming more important across the board, even at mass market level, kimonos, kimonos have already been huge but they are continuing to do really well. So definitely we are seeing Eastern inspired influences coming through,\" she says.\r\nAnn Edwards, founder of Mame Huku luxury handbags, takes traditional Japanese fabrics and crafts them into very modern designs. \r\nEach of her bags is unique and made from vintage obis - the central sash of a kimono dress.\r\n\"I've been collecting the fabrics for about 10 years. I'm a little bit obsessed now with Japanese textiles and each piece of fabric is a unique, one off piece that was commissioned specifically for the young woman in the family who made it,\" Edwards says.\r\nShe says her husband got so sick of her collection of silks cluttering up the house that he convinced her to find a new purpose for them, and so Mame Huku was born.\r\nFor Edwards the quality of the original Japanese silk weavers is what sets the bags apart.\r\n\"I'm crazy about the Japanese fabric because the quality of it is just unbelievable. I don't think we could even make fabric like this in the West. How the gold and the silver is woven, and the pure silks. The gradation, if you just look at the gradation of the silk within this it's amazing. You know, we do not do that and do not have any history of doing that,\" she says.\r\nHer bags cost around 500 UK pounds (approx. 650 US dollars) each. \r\nBut if you do splash out on one, it's unlikely you'll find anyone else with the same bag as you. \r\nSingaporean fashion designer Mashizan Masjum is at Pure to introduce his luxury shoes to the UK.\r\nHis shoes cost around 400 UK pounds (approx. 520 US dollars) a pair and the leather is cut and produced in Italy.\r\nMashizan says way the East is influencing fashion at Pure is all about the future, not the past. \r\n\"It's not the old Orientalism that we're talking about here, this is the new 21st Century where I mean China is a huge market for everyone around the world and it is a dominant global power, but at the same time I think with the rise of emerging designers from Asia I think that's something that people will start to notice, that creativity exists a lot in Asia as well,\" he says.\r\nMashizan is upbeat about the UK's exit from the EU, saying it could open up some exciting opportunities. \r\nAnd Brexit isn't keeping international brands away from exhibiting at the show. \r\nThere are buyers and visitors from 87 countries at the show.\r\nPure London runs until 25 July 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cf7928a5763f7c40716f0a950b0abb9f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
