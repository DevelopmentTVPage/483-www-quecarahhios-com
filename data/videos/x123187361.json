    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) Pakistan's former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Tuesday criticised the country's judiciary for rejecting his appeal over his disqualification from office and vowed again to fight a legal battle to clear his name.\r\nIn July, the Supreme Court barred him from office for concealing financial assets. \r\nSharif has since been replaced by a member of his ruling party but has vowed to fight and prove he never indulged in corruption. \r\nEarlier this month, the top court rejected Sharif's request for a review of its 28 July ruling.\r\nTuesday's remarks by Sharif came just after he made his first appearance before an anti-corruption court to face corruption charges earlier in the day. \r\nHe has returned home from London, where he travelled to see his ailing wife who is undergoing medical treatment in Britain.\r\nSharif is likely to be indicted on the second of October in connection with three corruption cases that were filed against him by the country's anti-corruption body earlier this month. \r\nSharif resigned after the Supreme Court disqualified him, but afterward said he was being punished over a trivial charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5ccb49395f60ec40015ad85b9610f479 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
