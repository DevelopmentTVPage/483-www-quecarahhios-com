    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Forecasters dialed back from their predictions of triple-digit heat across the Pacific Northwest, a region famous for cool weather where many people do not have air conditioning to help them endure the rare furnace-like blast.\r\nIn normally temperate Washington and Oregon, families generally get by on warm days by simply drawing shades and running fans.\r\nMany concerned communities have opened cooling centers and warned residents to stay hydrated, avoid strenuous activity and keep their dogs out of parked vehicles.\r\nThe latest forecast for Seattle predicted highs easing a bit from earlier predictions. The National Weather Service said the high for Wednesday would be 91 degrees (32.8 Celsius) and 94 (34.4 Celsius) on Thursday.\r\nThe weather service also revised forecasts for Portland to match or break its record high of 107 degrees (41.7 Celsius). Meteorologist David Bishop said the city is now looking at 104 (40 degrees Celsius) or 105 degrees (40.5 Celsius) on Wednesday and Thursday.\r\n\"With little to no cloud cover at night, the higher temperatures kind of hang around a little bit,\" Bishop said. That creates a cycle in which \"the next day is going to be a little bit warmer because we're already starting off warmer than the previous day.\"\r\nThe Northwest is better known for its fall, winter and spring rainy seasons. Even July and August are relatively mild months. But the powerful high-pressure system arrived just at the height of summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/b08b9a9b00807eed9098f6ad2628638a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
