    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) LEAD IN:\r\nTattooists are busy with their buzzing ink guns at Hong Kong's International Tattoo Convention. \r\nThe event - now in its fifth year - is drawing almost 300 tattoo artists from around the world, including several female artists keen to showcase their skills.\r\n\r\nSTORY-LINE:\r\nLocal and international tattoo artists are gathering in Hong Kong for what's claimed to be Asia's largest tattoo convention. \r\nEnthusiasts are lining up to get inked by well-known tattooists from Japan, Singapore, China and Taiwan. \r\nOrganiser Gabe Shum, who's a big name on Hong Kong's tattoo scene, says he hopes the event will help shed the stigma long associated with tattoos.\r\n\"I hope that there will be more participants (in this event), more members of the public will come and know more about our tattoos,\" he says.\r\n\"We are not asking everyone to get tattoos. Due to social advancement, more things should be accepted. \r\n\"Today, I can say that according to international statistics, on average one out of every three people has a tattoo. \r\n\"For example, in the previous Olympic Games, there were many young athletes\u2026 basically for every ten people, three or four had tattoos. \r\n\"Some of them had tattoos behind their ears. In fact, tattoos are now a part of pop culture. \r\n\"Tattoos represent us (represent who we are). Many parents are afraid that their children have tattoos. \r\n\"Instead of worrying, they should come and see, whether tattoos are as bad as they thought in the past.\"\r\nShum, who's known for his delicate freehand work, once tattooed former Manchester United footballer David Beckham.\r\nA ball signed by the English superstar is set to be auctioned off during the convention to raise money for a local cancer charity.\r\nBorn without a left forearm, Hong Kong-based tattoo artist Alley Leong says her disability hasn't negatively impacted her career.  \r\n\"In fact, there is no big difficulty (as a tattoo artist),\" she says.\r\n\"But sometimes after working for a long time, my waist hurts. It's no big deal. I can overcome (this problem).\"\r\nLeong says she was shy as a child. She found art and design a great way to express herself.\r\n\"Since I was a kid, I did not enjoy talking to others,\" she says.\r\n\"Maybe that's the reason why I use drawings to express myself.\"\r\nPolish tattoo artist, Aga Yadou, is visiting Hong Kong's tattoo convention for the first time. It was recommended by a Warsaw-based colleague.\r\n\"Yeah, it's my first time here,\" she says.\r\n\"My friend from the shop who is working with me in Warsaw, was here last time. \r\n\"And he said, it's great. So I ask him, if he wouldn't mind if I can come. So he arranged everything for us and I love it already.\"\r\nYadou's tattoos are watercolour inspired and often feature intricate floral designs and animals such as horses and foxes.\r\n\"The only thing I could expect, it's going to be different than European conventions,\" she says.\r\n\"And it's already very well organised. It's spacious and there is a lot of cool artists around.\"\r\nHong Kong's International Tattoo Convention runs 29 September to 1 October at the Kai Tak cruise terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9cfd86097e391bf0d465e3e489813d3e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
