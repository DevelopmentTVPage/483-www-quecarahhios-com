    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) ACCLAIMED ARTIST DAVID HOCKNEY UNVEILS HUGE PAINTING HE IS DONATING TO POMPIDOU CENTER\r\nRenowned British painter David Hockney unveiled the huge painting he is donating to the Pompidou Center in Paris, Tuesday (26 SEPT. 2017).\r\nTitled \"The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate, East Yorkshire,\" the 2011 painting includes 32 panels stretching more than three meters high and nearly 10 meters wide. \r\nThe work goes on display this week as part of a traveling retrospective of the 80-year-old's work.\r\n\"The Spring was an excitement for me because, having lived in California for 25 years, where there really is not much Spring, it's tropical really, and the Spring was very exciting for me to watch so that's what it was,\" explained Hockney.\r\nHockney is an innovator whose 60-year career has taken in sketching, painting, printmaking, photography and digital iPad experiments. \r\nHis depictions of sun-dappled Los Angeles swimming pools and wooded Yorkshire hills are among the best-known images in contemporary art.\r\nHockney says his hearing loss has helped sharpen his sense of space and perspective.\r\n\"If you lose one sense, you gain other senses, and I feel I could see space clearer. I put it down to the hearing loss. ... I can't tell what sound is coming from where.\"\r\nThe artist, who continues to paint, described his most recent project.\r\n\"I'm working on reverse perspective paintings. I've done quite a few actually. I'm very excited by it actually. I've just done about six big paintings. I'm very excited by it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/15e7f695651c0677a9de1b560d470604 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
