The group was responsible for the 2002 Bali bombings which killed 202 people.\r\nGhazali was a radical preacher and served four years in prison for a number of offences, including a major bank robbery carried out to fund the group's attacks.\r\nBut he says he is now a changed man and wants to prevent his young charges from becoming the next generation of Indonesian militants.\r\nBut that the world seems to be against them.\r\n\"People out there taunting children by saying their father is a bomber, a killer, against the state, it hurts us so much, it hurts children,\" he says.\r\nThere are 20 pupils at this unusual school.\r\nGhazali tells them stories about the life of the Prophet Muhammad to show them that Islam is a religion of love and mercy, not an ideology to justify a war against police, currently the most frequent target of militant attacks in Indonesia. \r\nThis thirteen year-old was sent here with his two younger brothers after they faced hostility at their previous school.\r\n\"I was insulted as a terrorist's child when my father was in prison. I was so sad,\" he says.\r\nBut the school's philosophy of peace has inspired him and he wants to become an Islamic teacher because \"many people who claim to know Islam but actually they don't know what Islam is and how to practice it\".\r\nThe school has faced some challenges.\r\nLocal villagers have cursed at the pupils, trampled and burned the school's banners and reported Ghazali to the police.\r\nBut this initial attitude has faded after police talked with villagers and raised awareness about its purpose. \r\nAt the request of the National Agency for Counter-Terrorism, the local government last year provided 30 hectares of land next to the school and the agency's chief collected donations from companies and businessmen that allowed a mosque and two classrooms for up to 60 students to be built.\r\nAnother school that can cater for 100 students has been set up with the agency's assistance in Lamongan, the East Java hometown of three brothers who assembled bombs used in the 2002 Bali attack.\r\nSuhardi Alius, Chief of the National Agency for Counter-Terrorism, says the children are \"victims of their parent's wrong ideology\". \r\nSix teachers have volunteered to help Ghazali and his wife teach the standard national curriculum as well as religious studies, Arabic and farming.\r\nAnd while they are educators they also have to be healers and role models too to help children traumatised by their family's radicalism and society's reaction to it.\r\nThe teachers have to be persuasive as they are teaching an Islam at odds with the extreme version the pupils have learnt from their parents.\r\nBut it seems the hard work is paying off.\r\nThis student's father was jailed for ten years for drug trafficking which was intended to fund extremism.\r\nBut the boy has no intention of following in those criminal footsteps.\r\n\"I want to be a policeman because there are so many drug users,\" he says.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/f16e9f4d313df1559cc7c74d45ab1aab \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
