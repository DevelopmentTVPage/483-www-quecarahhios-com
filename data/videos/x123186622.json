    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) U.S. President Donald Trump's health secretary has resigned, after his travel on costly charter flights triggered investigations and angered his boss.\r\nTom Price's partial repayment and public regrets couldn't save his job.\r\nThe Health and Human Services secretary became the first member of the president's Cabinet to leave office in a turbulent young administration that has seen several high-ranking White House aides ousted. Price served less than 8 months.\r\nTrump had said he was \"not happy\" with Price for hiring private charters on the taxpayer's dime for official travel, when cheaper commercial flights would have worked.\r\nPrice is a \"good man,\" Trump added, but he's \"not happy\" over the travel flap.\r\n\"I don't like the optics,\" he told reporters as he left the White House for the weekend.\r\nThe flap over Price has overshadowed Trump's agenda and prompted scrutiny of other Cabinet members' travel. The House Oversight and Government Reform committee has launched a broad investigation of top political appointees.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1cea2cd2f97dc79dd6b73143b4fca50e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
