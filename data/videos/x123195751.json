    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) \r\nASSOCIATED PRESS\r\nLos Angeles, 12 July 2017\r\n1. Wide of White Walker figure outside at Walt Disney Concert Hall, site of season 7 premiere of \"Game of Thrones\"\r\n2. SOUNDBITE (English) John Bradley, actor:\r\n\"It's hard to say goodbye because you have a double whammy of grief, because when characters die in the show, you are saying goodbye to characters that you love as a fan of the show and you're saying goodbye to actors you worked with as well. I'm clinging onto every single second that I got left being in 'Game of Thrones.' I don't really want to think about the end. Don't want to think about it.\"\r\n3. Tilt down Iain Glen wearing kilt\r\n4. SOUNDBITE (English) Iain Glen, actor:\r\n\"Now, we're a very tight, very bonded unit. So I think there will be a real sense of loss when it all concludes, when it all goes away. So maybe people are just preparing themselves for that sadness. I know I'll feel a huge void. And again, it's sort of unusual as an actor. You get used to ducking and diving, not knowing what's coming next - or maybe knowing one thing up ahead. But to know that something is coming around, each year, that you love doing, that is a huge hit, you've got to cherish it while it's there. Because you know, it won't be.\"\r\n5. Wide of Jerome Flynn talking to reporter\r\n6. SOUNDBITE (English) Jerome Flynn, actor:\r\n\"Each season that comes along, it feels kind of like a gift - like a Christmas gift to me. So we don't know from one season to the next what's going to happen. So I'm just kind of taking it and trying not to miss it before it's gone. Just to kind of savor the extraordinary nature of the job. There is definitely not another one like this that will come along for me. So just enjoying it while it's here.\"\r\n7. Wide Isaac Hempstead Wright talks with reporter\r\n8. SOUNDBITE (English) Isaac Hempstead Wright, Actor:\r\n\"I don't want to think about it yet. I haven't said any goodbyes. I'm going, I'll see you next season. I'll see you next season. Maybe not the one after that, but definitely next season.\"\r\n9. Wide of Nathalie Emmanuel talking to reporter\r\n10. SOUNDBITE (English) Nathalie Emmanuel, actress: \"I think saying goodbye will be difficult when it happens. It will be weird not going back to film, at whatever point, you know. But I think we'll probably just say it as it happens. I don't know if there's any... I haven't really had - allowed myself to say goodbye yet, because it's not goodbye just yet. And I hope we all stay in touch.\"\r\n11 .
