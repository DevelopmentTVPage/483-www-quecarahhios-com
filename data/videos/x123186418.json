    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) TRADITIONAL DESIGNS FOR WEDDINGS AND CASUAL WEAR SHOW IN NORTH KOREA\r\n\"Our cloth, our clothes\" was the theme of this year's Korean Clothes Exhibition, where traditional dress was marketed for both weddings and casual wear. \r\nThe 15th Exhibition of Korean Clothes opened at the Central Youth Hall in Pyongyang on Wednesday 27 September with a catwalk show featuring mostly \"chima choggori\" - what North Korea calls the traditional dress for women. \r\nIt's a wide dress with a tighter top fixed above the waist in bright colors.\r\nAround the hall, hundreds of mannequins displayed different designs for men, women and children.\r\nNorth Korean authorities like to promote traditional clothes as a part of national identity, but it's normally women who are expected to wear the national costume on holidays and anniversaries, when they take part in organized dancing events or other shows.\r\nFashion on the streets of Pyongyang is much more conventional, with women often in high-waisted tight and narrow skirts and fitted shirts. \r\nWhile many men stick to traditional tunics and boxy suits, some younger men look sharper with shirts, trousers, jackets - all in a narrower profile.\r\nThe time when North Koreans really put effort into wearing traditional dress is at weddings. \r\nThere's now an industry of photo-taking before weddings, with young couples visiting landmarks around the city before their big moment. \r\nNormally the women will be in elaborate Korean dresses with the men in army uniform or European-style suits and ties.\r\nAt this year's Korean Clothes Exhibition, one exhibitor from Pyongyang got a lot of attention - a clothes shop from the city's central district.\r\nIts manager - Jo Jong Sun - said his company puts a lot of effort in trying to get lighter colour combinations with a traditional theme, using intricate decorations. \r\nShe also wanted to emphasize that the materials used in the clothing were locally-made - a common emphasis in North Korea, which is trying to rely on developing its economy in the face of sanctions.\r\nThe Korean Clothes Exhibition, which has been held every year since 2003, ran until Friday 29 September.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/536344b924ff2fe67331e5507633b3ca \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
