    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) The death toll from Mexico's magnitude 7.1 earthquake rose to 361 Sunday after another casualty was confirmed in the capital. \r\nNational Civil Defense chief Luis Felipe Puente reported on Twitter that the dead include 220 people killed in Mexico City by the Sept. 19 quake. The rest were in Morelos, Puebla and three other states.\r\nThe toll has continued to climb gradually nearly two weeks after the earthquake as bodies keep being pulled from the rubble - though nearly all the collapse sites have been cleared by now in Mexico City.\r\nSearch efforts continue at the site of a collapsed seven-story office building in a central neighborhood of the capital, where 41 bodies have been recovered. \r\nMayor Miguel Angel Mancera said Sunday that eight people are still believed to be missing inside the wreckage of the office building, one of 38 Mexico City buildings that collapsed in the quake.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/54b1daf0e17db86aad059362fd09ef0f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
