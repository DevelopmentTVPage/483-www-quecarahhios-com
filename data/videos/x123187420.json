    "description": "(24 Sep 2017) LEADIN:\r\nOn the eve of an historic vote in northern Iraq, Kirkuk's governor is adamant that his city will be taking part.\r\nMeanwhile, in Beirut, a political analyst warns of the perils of change. \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nIraq's Kurds are set to vote on Monday in a referendum on support for independence that has stirred fears of instability across the region as the war against the Islamic State group winds down. \r\nThe Kurds are likely to approve the referendum, but the non-binding vote is not expected to result in any formal declaration of independence.\r\nInitial results from the poll are expected on Tuesday, with the official results announced later in the week.\r\nHere in Kirkuk, the governor says that despite all the opposition, the vote for Kurdish independence would go ahead in the disputed city on Monday.\r\n\"We did not expect anyone to tell us: 'go have a referendum and we will support you'. These things don't happen. You have to decide and have a referendum, and later people will come round and help remove the obstacles,\" he says.\r\nThe situation of Kirkuk, a mixed city of Kurds, Turkmen and Arabs, is complicated by the fact that its constitutional status is undecided between the federal government and the northern Kurdish region.\r\nCurrently it is under Kurdish control and the Kurdish government is including it in the referendum process, despite protests from Baghdad and many non-Kurdish local politicians.\r\nKareem says he hopes that the Iraqi government will not cut off the salaries of federal employees in the city, although he admits that this has happened before in the Kurdish region.\r\nKareem was removed from his position by the Iraqi parliament for his support for the referendum but refused to step down.\r\nMeanwhile, speaking in Lebanon, Ibrahim Bayram, a political analyst at Al-Nahar Lebanese Newspaper, says the referendum is \"an adventure\".\r\nIn his office in downtown Beirut, Bayram says that the stability and economic prosperity that the self-governing region enjoys right now would vanish if the referendum produces a 'yes' result. \r\n\"Baghdad, Turkey and Iran announced its rejection to the referendum so this area that is enjoying stability and economic prosperity will not stay as it is,\" he says. \r\nThe Kurdish region has repeatedly ignored accusations from Baghdad that the vote is unconstitutional.\r\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said that Iraq is prepared to intervene militarily if the referendum results in violence.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a5420588713844b2b5ff753fbd1023de \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
