    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) LEADIN:\r\nChildren once afraid of the water are learning to swim as part of a charity program aimed at reducing the number of drownings in Bangladesh.\r\nUp to 18,000 children drown in the delta nation every year. Charity workers say most of these deaths could have been prevented by teaching children basic swimming skills.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nOffering prayers at the graves of her two sons, Samela Begum says she will live with a life-long regret - she did not make sure her children knew how to swim.\r\nIn May, Begum lost both her sons - aged 14 and 21 and a nephew aged 17 - to a river near their grandfather's village not far from Dhaka.\r\nThe youngest boy fell into the water and the other two jumped in to save him \u2013 Begum says all three were swept away in the strong current.\r\n\"I have lost my sons, hope that no-one else faces such a situation,\" says a tearful Begum.\r\n\"Hope everyone teaches their children to swim. Hope all will give time to their children and never let the children go beyond their eyesight.\"\r\nDrowning is a major cause of death among youngsters in Bangladesh, claiming up to 18,000 children under the age of 18-years-old every year and 43 percent of deaths among children under five, according to a 2011 government survey. \r\nExperts say a majority of these deaths occur in natural water bodies, such as ponds and canals.\r\n\"Almost every household in the rural community, you can see there is a pond,\" says Aminur Rahman, a lead researcher with the Dhaka-based Center for Injury Prevention and Research.\r\n\"So there is wide exposure of water bodies for the children to be drowned, that's number one. \r\n\"Number two is lack of awareness, you know. People do not realise that these water(s) are so hazardous for the children to be drowned. \r\n\"And also lack of supervision, you know, is one of the main reasons for drowning and also there is lack of skills, like swimming skills, like first response skills.\"\r\nIn an effort to help mothers like Begum, a British charity has partnered with a Bangladeshi research group to offer swimming lessons in this central Bangladeshi farming village for children from poor, rural families. \r\nYoungsters once frightened to go near the water practice how to float in a makeshift swimming pool made of bamboo.\r\nThey're learning to swim in order to avoid becoming one of the 50 children who die each day in the hundreds of canals, rivers and streams crisscrossing the delta nation of Bangladesh. \r\n\"We often travel by the river route,\" says one young participant.\r\n\"If we fall in any kind of danger at that time, we would be able to save our lives by swimming.\"\r\nThe British charity - named 'The Sreepur Village, Bangladesh' after its flagship location - recently added swimming lessons to its overall program, aimed at offering commercial skills to some of the 142 single mothers and their 280 children recruited from across the South Asian nation. \r\nThe village was established in the 1980s by a British charity worker to help impoverished Bangladeshi women.\r\nIt's outfitted with modest concrete homes, playgrounds, a clinic and over 18 acres (eight hectares) of farmland. \r\nThe mothers and their children live at Sreepur Village for up to three years. \r\nThe program begins with smaller children spending a half-hour splashing around in a three-foot-deep swimming tank strewn with brightly coloured toys. \r\nA dozen other children wait nearby for their 30-minute turn, some of them jogging, stretching or doing light gymnastic exercises before diving in. \r\nNearby, in a natural pond, two instructors teach about six older children basic strokes and survival techniques. \r\n\"This is a drowning prevention program,\" says Matthew Silvester, a child development specialist from London, who works in the village. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8efdd5520b5fa5a4bbb4eaa078b7c6c2 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
