    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) Search teams were still digging in dangerous piles of rubble on Monday, hoping against the odds to find survivors at collapsed buildings in Mexico City, where the death toll from the September 19 earthquake rose to 186, and 324 nationwide.\r\nOfficials said they had cleared only 103 of Mexico City's nearly 9,000 schools to reopen on Monday.\r\nThe need to inspect 98 percent of the capital's public and private schools nearly a week after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake was a stark indicator of just how long the path back to normalcy will be.\r\nRescue operations aimed at finding living survivors remained active in at least three sites in Mexico City - two apartment buildings and an office building - but hope dimmed every time rescuers had to retreat due to instability of debris. But no one has been found alive since Wednesday, when a woman was pulled from debris.\r\nAs darkness fell on Sunday, prayers were held by families who have been gathered near the collapsed office hoping missing relatives will be found. A crowd of onlookers watching swelled, and so did the number of volunteer workers. Teachers at one corner tried to entertain children of some of the waiting families. There also appeared to be more people offering psychological support.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/bc2f9beac875bdee128299134432db02 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
