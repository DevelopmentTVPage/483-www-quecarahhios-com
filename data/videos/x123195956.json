    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) BOBA FETT ACTOR JEREMY BULLOCH TALKS PESKY FANS; FAVORITE 'STAR WARS' MEMORIES\r\nBoba Fett is a character synonymous with mystery, danger and brooding menace.\r\nThankfully, the man who played the masked bounty hunter in the original \"Star Wars\" movies \u2013 actor Jeremy Bulloch \u2013 is more approachable than his on-screen antihero. But he still has a stern word or two for bothersome fans.\r\nThe 72-year-old said he receives a lot of fan mail and - while most of it is from genuine well-wishers - occasionally he gets messages from \"grumpy, angry people\" pushing their luck.\r\n\"Some people send like 15 bits of paper and you just wish they'd just say, 'That's fair enough, that's enough now,'\" he explained. \"But genuine, genuine people will send in the right stuff. So it's not too bad.\"\r\nBulloch was speaking at \"Star Wars Identities\" \u2013 an exhibition currently running at The O2 in London.\r\nIt places the visitor at the center of the exhibition experience with a special interactive identity quest that spans the duration of the visit\r\n\"I think that's terrific,\" said Bulloch, having spent a few hours moving through the show. \"It's a terrific piece. You look around here and you have, of course, Boba Fett, but the costumes and the characters look fantastic.\"\r\nThe collection features some 200 objects from the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art \u2013 including props, models, and costumes for popular characters like Darth Vader and Stormtroopers.\r\n\"It just gives you a shiver,\" said Bulloch, on seeing the Boba Fett outfit again. \"Amazing memories.\"\r\nBulloch's first appearance as Boba Fett was in 1980's \"Star Wars: Episode V \u2013 The Empire Strikes Back.\" He also reprised the role for the 1983 sequel, \"Return of the Jedi.\" \r\n\"Everyone had such a fun time,\" recalled the actor. \"You'd finish at the end of the day and just go off, have a half a pint, not a pint, half a pint, and say see you tomorrow. Because everyone looked forward to being back again the following day.\"\r\nSo what does Bulloch think of the recent \"Star Wars\" movies \u2013 \"Star Wars: Episode VII \u2013 The Force Awakens\" and \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\"? (Bulloch had a cameo in the latter movie as an Imperial officer). \r\n\"I think they have terrific power,\" he said. \r\n\"One or two maybe a bit too much violence going on. But they are quick and they're really buzzing, everyone's having a great time. So far so good, as they say.\"\r\nThe \"Star Wars Identities\" exhibition at The O2 in London runs until 3 September 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1518c0eb37ac2e9a0b5a471654db57a2 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
