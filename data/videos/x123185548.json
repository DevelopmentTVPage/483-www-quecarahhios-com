More than 300 samples arrived and researchers tested 198 of them for five of the most common types of neonics.\r\nOverall, 75 percent of the samples had at least one neonic, 45 percent had two or more and 10 percent had four or more.\r\nProfessor David Goulson, from the University of Sussex, is a peer commentator on the results of today's study: \"A worldwide survey of neonicotinoids in honey\".\r\nHe says: \"The majority of the samples contain concentrations which are high enough to have an effect on the bees, probably not to kill them, at least not quickly, so below the lethal dose, but enough to do them other forms of harm, so called sub-lethal effects. So we know for example these chemicals, they attack the brain of the insect and they interfere with their ability to learn and to navigate, which is really important for a bee. A honey bee and other kinds of bee they have to be able to find their way to and from patches of flowers and back to their hive and if they get lost then they're as good as dead.\"\r\nIt's not just the brains of the bees that are being messed up according to Goulson.\r\nHe says: \"Also we know these chemicals at low concentrations mess up the immune system of the honey bee so then they get infected with diseases, so the long and the short of it is that we should be worried about this, that it seems that a large proportion of the world's honey bees and probably other bees too are being continually exposed to toxins at a level that will be doing them harm.\"\r\nOne surprising result from the study is that the scientists found the toxins in honey samples from places like Tahiti, which aren't immediately associated with industrial farming.\r\nScientists say farmers in other parts of the world are being encouraged to use the pesticides as demand from Europe falls.\r\nGoulson believes the reason the neonicotinoids are worse than spraying pesticides because they damage the surrounding ecosystem.\r\nGlassborow's hives appear to be thriving.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/21aa6ead771ed86bb9a7285c16e99539 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
