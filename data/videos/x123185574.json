They're going to be talking to fellow NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins, might hear him refer to his Hopper throughout and he's going to be the ground IV basically walking through their procedures today.

Now back to work.\"\r\nUPSOUND (English) Unidentified Mission Control operator:\r\n\"Exactly. Just a reminder, slow and steady, and let's go get 'er done.\"\r\n7. Animation of spacewalk, UPSOUND (English) Jaclyn Kagey, Lead U.S. Spacewalk #44 Officer, describing the mission:\r\n\"There are two blankets that need to be released to uncover the joint interface. Since the crew cannot reach all six EDFs or the bolts that we need to release. At one point in time we will release to rotate the arm. Then we will power down and drive the D-mate connector and finally release the other four.  The degraded joint will be removed and the crew will translate it to the seat of cart to attempt stow location. The crew inspects the interfaces prior to meeting and then they will install four bolts to an initial torque. We will power up the arm. And rotate it so they can really reach the other two bolts. Do those to have final torque and then we will rotate it again to be able to do a final torque on the first four bolts. Time permitting pictures of the bolt final config will be taken prior to putting them MLI blankets back on.\" \r\nNASA - AP CLIENTS ONLY\r\nIn Space - 5 October 2017\r\n8. Wide, astronauts moving arm UPSOUND (English) Unidentified Mission Control operator:\r\n\"With an essentially new version of it. This one that they're replacing has been in use for about 16 years now and has been used over 400 times. We replace it with one that's only been used about 14 times as we heard from our friends of the Canadian Space Agency a little bit earlier in the broadcast today.\" \r\n9. Close-up link on arm\r\n10.
