    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Princess Diana's former bodyguard has defended a new British documentary which contains recordings of the late Princess candidly discussing her personal life.\r\nFormer royal protection officer Ken Wharfe is a contributor to the film, \"Diana: In Her Own Words\" and provides a commentary on the recordings. \r\nHe worked for the Princess between 1986 and 1994.  \r\nSome royal watchers have called the programme, to be broadcast on Channel 4 on Sunday, August 6, a betrayal of the late princess' privacy, but Wharfe disagrees.\r\nChannel 4 said the video tapes, made in the early 1990s, are an \"important historical source\" and place Diana \"front and centre\" in her own story as Britain marks 20 years since her unexpected death.\r\nWharfe also says he believes the Royal Family will watch the film.\r\nThe channel said that although the recordings were made in private, \"the subjects covered are a matter of public record and provide a unique insight into the preparations Diana undertook to gain a public voice and tell her own personal story.\"\r\nDiana Spencer married Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, in 1981 and the couple had two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry.  \r\nThey separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996, the year before Diana died in a car crash in Paris, aged 36.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/027288fc901bb51145bd45c65839b6ef \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
