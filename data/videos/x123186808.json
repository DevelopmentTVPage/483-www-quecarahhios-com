It's an art form rather than something that you consume and throw away, it's something that can last over decades,\" she says.\r\nSix films highlighting Moroccan talent were shown at the opening of the festival: \"Riad of My Dreams\" by director Zineb Tamourt, \"Assia\" by Malika Zairi, \"Adam 99% Love\" by Narjis Tahiri, \"Amal\" by Aicha Senna, \"Badad\" by Nadia Ghalia Lmhaidi and \"No\" by Dimna Bounaylat.\r\nOther films from Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and across the Middle East were shown. \r\nThe event is organised by the Bouregreg Association and runs from 25th to 30th September 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c708168141d2ec56e196c8b47e7bccde \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
