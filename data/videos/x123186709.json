But some younger men look sharper with shirts, trousers, jackets all in a narrower profile.\r\nThe time when North Koreans really put effort into wearing traditional dress is at weddings. \r\nThere's now an industry of photo-taking before weddings, with young couples who can afford it visiting landmarks around the city dressed up in their finest before the big day. \r\nNormally the women will be in elaborate Korean dresses and the men in army uniform or European-style suits and ties.\r\nAt the Korean Clothes Exhibition this time, one exhibitor from Pyongyang gets a lot of attention - a clothes shop from Pyongyang's central district.\r\nIt's manager Jo Jong Sun says they put a lot of effort in trying to get lighter colour combinations with a traditional theme, and using intricate decorations. \r\nShe also wanted to emphasise that the material for the cloth was locally-made - that's a common emphasis in North Korea which is trying to rely on developing its economy in the face of sanctions.\r\nThe Korean Clothes Exhibition ran until Friday 29 September. It's been held every year since 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/db262725b37dcc7e0144d7eb14d30e30 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
