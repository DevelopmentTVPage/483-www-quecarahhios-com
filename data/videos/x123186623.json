He responded to a shouted question before departing the White House, hours after the State Department announced it is pulling more than half its diplomats out of Havana.\r\nTrump said there was a \"big problem\" in Cuba. He said \"they did some very bad things.\" But he did not specify who he believes is responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/2ef7ed9f038fa52e43a9e374c236af23 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
