    "description": "(22 Sep 2017) VIOLA DAVIS' BEST TEACHER 'TAUGHT ME THAT I WAS ENOUGH' \r\nViola Davis says her best-ever teacher gave her a sense of confidence. \r\n\"He taught me that I was enough,\" the Oscar-winning actress says of her Upward Bound teacher Jeff Kenyon.\r\nDavis, Miranda Cosgrove and Maria Bello remembered their top teachers at a recent education-focused event in Santa Monica, California. \r\n52-year-old Davis, who is currently starring in the series \"How to Get Away With Murder,\" grew up poor in Rhode Island, and has long credited the government-sponsored Upward Bound program with helping her prepare for higher education.\r\n\"The best thing he told me is that I'm important.  You know, and I think that there's a lot of probably awkward high school students out there that have kind of X'd themselves out.  You know, it's an awkward phase in life.  You know that,\" Davis said.  \"You don't feel like you're pretty enough, good enough, smart enough \u2013 nothing is enough.  He taught me that I was enough.  He listened to me, you know?  That was the best education he gave me.\"\r\nBello, known for her role in \"A History of Violence,\" remembered a ninth-grade political science teacher who helped her find her sense of social justice. \r\n\"She put me on my path to civil rights and social justice, and I'll never forget her,\" Bello said.  \"I read Elie Wiesel's 'Night' - 'Night' - for the first time, and learned about the Holocaust, and it hit me so deeply.  I realized I had to do everything in my power to stand up for people in general.\"\r\nFormer Nickelodeon star Miranda Cosgrove had fond memories of both her long-time home-schooling teacher and her kindergarten teacher, Miss Sapia.\r\n\"She did all sorts of art projects in her room and I actually remember for Halloween, like, she would have everybody paint a witch in class, and I was, like, so excited to do that.  And then also I have another teacher named Patty Foy, that I had all through high school, when I did home-schooling, and she's amazing,\" Cosgrove said. \r\nThe 24-year-old actress and singer says Foy taught her to pursue her passions. \r\n\"She always encouraged me to try different things and to actually go with what I was inspired to do.  Like, I love art and a lot of classes that I wasn't actually taking in school,\" she said.  \"I love photography.  And she would always, like, to tell me that I should keep trying at that and do that.  And she even helps me now - like, when I write an essay for like USC out.  I can email her my essay and be like, 'Is this any good?' And she'll be like, 'No, it's good.'  So she's really sweet.\"\r\nThe event was a one-hour telecast called EIF Presents: XQ Super School Live - intended to spur discussion about the state of high schools in the country and how they might be changed in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6138372c10633ea501410c3116b16a35 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
