There has also been widespread anger in Jordan over last month's deadly shooting in which an Israeli Embassy guard killed two Jordanians, including a 16-year-old. Authorities said the guard opened fire after the teen attacked him with a screwdriver during a furniture delivery.\r\nHazan and al-Saoud, both provocative politicians, had quarrelled publicly in recent days, exchanging barbs through media statements.\r\nAl-Saoud challenged Hazan to a face off at the Allenby Bridge crossing after the Israeli berated Jordan, claiming Israel always \"protects their posterior, day and night. They need a little re education.\"\r\nHazan picked up the gauntlet but struck a more jocular tone ahead of the rendezvous, posting photos of getting a haircut and tweeting: \"A gentleman is never late!\"\r\nHe said he would meet al-Saoud and \"make him an offer he can't refuse.\" His spokesman Daniel Zirlin said the meeting would be \"non-violent\" and would carry \"a message of reconciliation and peace.\"\r\nAl-Saoud struck a harsher tone, telling reporters on his way to the crossing that he was \"serious about going to the bridge and beating up this dirty person.\"\r\n\"We want to tell Netanyahu that if the door to jihad (holy war) was open, the Jordanians would stomp on them (Israelis) with their shoes,\" al-Saoud said.\r\nHazan, who made headlines earlier this year when he snapped an unexpected selfie with President Donald Trump after he landed in Tel Aviv, was heading to the bridge on Wednesday morning when the prime minister's office called.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1b0d4cf29df9493852e65cacd0377413 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
