    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) AARON KWOK GUSHES ABOUT BABY GIRL AT FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE AFTER BECOMING DAD\r\nIt's a girl for Hong Kong superstar Aaron Kwok and new wife, Moka Fang. \r\nThe 51 year old actor confirmed the gender of his newborn baby at a fashion event in Hong Kong, Tuesday (26 SEPT. 2017). \r\nKwok was making his first public appearance since announcing on social media last Friday that he had became a father.  \r\nThe \"Cold War\" star grinned from ear to ear as he talked about his new arrival. Calling his daughter his \"love from a past life,\" Kwok described how moved he was by her birth.\r\n\"The three of us were all crying.  If you didn't experience it yourself, you don't know what it's like.  When I saw the birth of this little life, I felt that the world has changed, completely changed.  It was such a moving moment.  This is life, you keep growing and keep learning\", Kwok gushed.\r\nKwok also revealed that the baby weighed 6 lbs at birth but did not disclose her birth date.  The actor said that name of the baby will be determined by her grandparents, who are over the moon about their granddaughter's arrival.\r\nHong Kong's former most eligible bachelor, Kwok tied the knot earlier this year with a young model from China.  Rumors had swirled for months that the new Mrs. Kwok was expecting, but the newlyweds never confirmed the pregnancy news.  \r\nNow, thanks to his new bundle of joy, Kwok says he's a changed man.\r\n\"My friends don't see me out now.   Basically when I have a day off, I'm at home, spending time with the family\u2026I feel like that's the responsibility of a dad.  You should take good care of your family and stay by their side.  That's the most important thing to me right now\", said Kwok.  \r\nThis is the first child for both Kwok and Fang.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/965dda771d6a70070d9adc3023b11807 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
