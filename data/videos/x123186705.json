    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Thousands of anti-referendum protesters have held a mock-ballot in Madrid to demonstrate against Sunday's referendum on Catalonian independence.\r\nHazte Oir, an organisation aimed at promoting public democracy, invited citizens to cast votes in a fake ballot box in Madrid's Sol square.\r\nProtesters believe if there was to be vote, Spaniards living outside the Catalonia region should also be included.\r\n\"We want to show in a symbolic way support to those Catalonians that are for the unity of all of Spain, they want Catalonia to remain part of Spain. And, secondly, we want to vote in favour of the unity of Spain as a nation,\" said Ignacio Assuage, president of Hazte Oir.\r\nThe protest comes as Spain's government cabinet spokesman says there will not be a referendum on Catalonia's independence on Sunday as announced by the regional Catalan government.\r\nCulture Minister Inigo Mendez de Vigo accuses the secessionist coalition ruling the northeastern region of bending the laws to go ahead with a vote regardless of warnings from courts and a suspension by the country's Constitutional Court earlier this month.\r\nCatalan authorities say they will declare independence within 48 hours after announcing the vote's results if 'yes' wins. \r\nThe Spanish government has fought the referendum with a myriad of legal actions that have been criticized by many in Catalonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9d5862db403f9e84e3239d84a20f6b23 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
