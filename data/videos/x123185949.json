The answer could reshape American politics.\r\nKennedy suggested that courts could be involved in placing limits on extremely partisan electoral maps.\r\nBut he did not tip his hand at all about whether the Wisconsin map that favors Republicans crossed a line and violates the Constitution.\r\nThere was little doubt about where the rest of the court stood.\r\nThe liberal justices appeared to favor the Democratic voters who challenged the Wisconsin plan.\r\nFollowing the arugments, former Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger spoke out against Gerrymandering. \r\nSchwarzenegger said it should not be a partisan issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4f360d738f1732e2e72332c0eaa852a8 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
