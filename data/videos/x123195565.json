    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) On Friday, Venezuelan government supporters prepared to walk to the National Assembly in Caracas where the official swearing in of the newly elected members of that body will be convened.   \r\nThe body's 545 delegates were expected to be installed at the legislative palace in a room just yards (metres) from the chamber where the opposition-controlled National Assembly meets. \r\nPresident Nicolas Maduro, who has said he will use the assembly to punish his opponents, planned to attend the opening session.\r\nA large security contingent was deployed throughout the city to ensure the event would take place without confrontations. \r\nMembers of the National Assembly, led by the opposition, abstained from holding a session inside Parliament. They have scheduled a march for later today.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/bd5d2f74671380b4f09ef55375ac22e3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
