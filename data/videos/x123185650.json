    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) A neo-fascist group organised a torch-lit rally on Wednesday to protest against an illegal mosque located near the centre of Rome. \r\nThe march was convened by CasaPound after a young couple was reportedly attacked with punches and kicks when they were spotted kissing in the Esquilino neighbourhood by a mosque-goer on September 24. \r\nA Carabinieri patrol arrived on the scene and detained a 24-year old Malian national on charges of causing injuries and for resisting detention.\r\nCasaPound members have been asking authorities to shut down the mosque in Via San Vito in Rome, not far from the movement\u2019s headquarters.\r\nThey claim the Islamic centre and the Mosque, which were shut down by authorities in February, reopened illegally just recently. \r\nThe group believes the mosque's presence to be indicative of social decay in the Rome neighbourhood with illegal migrants stranded on the street, and an increase in criminal activity, especially drug dealing. \r\nOn Wednesday CasaPound activists marched peacefully in front of the illegal mosque holding flags and banners, and then lit torches in a nearby square yelling slogans to demand it shut down. \r\nCreated as a social movement to help under-privileged Italians, the small neo-fascist group has been grabbing headlines and gaining notoriety with its fierce opposition to migrants arriving in Italy, as it seeks inroads into Italian politics with the ambition of entering parliament next spring and forming a government in a decade.\r\nCombining progressive policies such as gay rights and maintaining abortion rights with die-hard nationalism, the party is growing with the support of people across the country, where Fascism never completely disappeared despite it's defeat as a political movement seven decades ago.\r\nAuthorities say the group has caused violence during larger marches and CasaPound has recently been active in disrupting efforts to house migrants. \r\nEarlier this month, its members violently clashed with leftists at a meeting about migrant housing in Rome. \r\nAnd in June, CasaPound activists attacked and injured volunteers inside Milan's city hall ahead of a similar meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/51f43732ae69c033db3f3add460dbeb5 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
