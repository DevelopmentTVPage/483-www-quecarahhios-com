    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) Germany celebrated its first same-sex weddings on Sunday, after a new law came into force putting gay and lesbian couples on an equal legal footing with heterosexual couples.\r\nTown halls in Berlin, Hamburg and elsewhere opened their doors to mark the event, made possible by a surprise vote in parliament three months earlier.\r\nAt Berlin's Schoeneberg district, about 60 guests and an equal number of journalists packed into the town hall's \"Golden Room\" to witness the marriage of Karl Kreile and his partner of 38 years, Bodo Mende.\r\nThe grooms entered the room to the popular \"Wedding March\" by 19th-century German composer Felix Mendelssohn, before saying their vows and signing the marriage documents to applause and cheers from the assembled guests.\r\nKreile, 59, and Mende, 60, had been campaigning for gay rights for decades and said they were honoured to be the first same-sex couple to marry in Germany. \r\nAfter cutting the wedding cake - featuring a rainbow flag and the words \"marriage for all\" - the couple planned to hold a small reception and fly to Vienna later in the week for a five-day honeymoon.\r\nThe couple first registered their partnership in 2002, when Germany introduced registered partnerships.\r\nBut those gave same-sex couples fewer rights than heterosexual couples who married.\r\nChancellor Angela Merkel long opposed same-sex marriages, only agreeing to a free vote in parliament on the matter in June, shortly before national elections.\r\nThe bill, which enjoyed strong public support, passed by a wide margin, with 393 lawmakers voting in favour of marriage equality and 226 - including Merkel - voting against.\r\nSome hurdles remain, including the fact that women can't automatically recognise motherhood of a lesbian partner's child, and the software used to record marriages doesn't currently allow for two entries with the same sex.\r\nStill, those attending Sunday's ceremony in Schoeneberg said Germany's decision to allow same-sex marriages - the 23rd country worldwide to do so - was a big step.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4cdb0a178d0e9a40b6f268eb5c2c0e1d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
