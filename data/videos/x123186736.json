    "description": "(28 Sep 2017) LEADIN:\r\nFrom 110-metre mega yachts to eco-friendly cruisers, expedition vessels to high-speed sports boat, luxury knows no bounds at the Monaco Yacht Show.\r\nYacht sailing millionaires have almost unlimited options when it comes to cruising the Mediterranean, or perhaps going on an arctic expedition.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nSunrise on Port Hercule, venue of the glitzy annual Monaco Yacht Show.\r\nGlittering in the early morning sun is Dutch shipyard Oceanco's award-winning 110-mere mega yacht, named 'Jubilee'.\r\nIt's claimed to be the largest yacht ever built in the Netherlands, meaning room for around 30 guests and 39 crew members. The price tag ? It's thought to be priced around $300 million USD.\r\n\"The super yacht market is healthy, it's good,\" says Stewart Campbell from yacht guide Boat International.\r\n\"So, brokerage, so that's second hand sales are up this year compared to last year. There's been 300 sales on the brokerage market. \r\n\"The new built sector is good, there's more yachts in construction now, 780 projects, than have been in production in the last four years. So, it's a five-year high. So the market is generally very good.\"\r\nFor the climate conscious yacht buyer, Netherlands-based Heesen Yachts is showcasing its new 50-metre super yacht, named 'Home'.\r\nThe new vessel is focused on fuel efficiency and comfort, boasting a lightweight hull and simplistic design.\r\nIts hybrid propulsion engine claims to operate near-silent in electric mode, while still claiming a nautical range of around 3,750 nautical miles and a top speed of 16.3 knots.\r\n\"To say that lots of clients come running to our door saying that they must have hybrid propulsion systems would be an exaggeration,\" admits Mark Cavendish from Heesen Yachts.\r\n\"To be honest, this was something that we introduced because we saw there was an opportunity in the market for clients who are interested in that and who do want that. \r\n\"So we responded to this by developing this hybrid system, we brought it to market and the yacht sold very quickly.\"\r\nFor the adventurous yachting enthusiast that's tired of the Mediterranean's calm shores, Fraser Yachts is exhibiting its 77-metre expedition yacht 'Legend'.\r\nOriginally built as a ice-breaking ship, the converted $49 million USD explorer is capable of venturing through the world's remotest oceans.\r\nBut why stop there? There's also a helipad, snowmobiles and a personal submarine to explore the depths.\r\nJan-Jaap Minnema from Fraser Yachts explains \"so we're talking about charter on Antarctica, going to Greenland, doing the Northwest Passage, well you see the helicopters onboard, do helicopter skiing in Greenland. The whole yacht is conceived for the high-end charter market in cold areas.\"\r\nLegend's classically-styled interior is capable of homing 26 guests, plus 19 crew members. Onboard there's a gym, spa and movie theatre.\r\n\"If you go to these remote areas, there's literally nothing,\" says Minnema. \r\n\"There's no infrastructure whatsoever. So you have to bring your own town if you want, or your own hotel to feel comfortable in safety and security, of course.\"\r\nAdventuring yacht owners can even purchase rugged support vessels, like this 70-metre 'Game Changer' by Netherlands-based Damen.\r\nIt allows luxury vessels to travel to destinations with less established infrastructure, ferrying staff, guides, pilots, perhaps security personnel. \r\nIt's equipped with a fully-functioning helipad, plus room for larger tenders, water toys and submersibles. \r\n\"There's certainly a movement in the industry towards leaner, more efficient yachts and that could be anything from more slippery naval architecture to hybrid propulsion, drive systems etc,\" says Boat International's Campbell.\r\nThe four-day annual Monaco Yacht Show runs 27-30 September.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9b8006ec9ab7786aefbc497a80d6de9e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
