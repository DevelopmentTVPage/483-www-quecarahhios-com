    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) LEADIN:\r\nAn Egyptian woman is forging a creative niche in the normally male-dominated automotive industry.\r\nSara Diab decorates Cairo's cars with unique, hand-drawn designs.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nSara Diab is transforming an ordinary silver car into something special.\r\nShe's using her artistic talent to decorate its wing mirrors and bonnet.\r\nThe intricate patterns she carefully draws on the paint work are her own design.\r\nDiab is an archaeology graduate but has been working in this unusual job for the last two years.\r\n\"I first started with a small drawing on one of my friend's cars and he really liked it. Then I started sharing my drawing designs on my Facebook page. And lots of users loved them,\" she says.\r\nThe artist doesn't work from a studio. Instead, she rents a space at a car wash and clients bring their vehicles here for her to work on.\r\nThe designs can take one or two weeks to complete and the price varies according to the complexity of the pattern.\r\nAnd Diab makes sure she uses the right materials so all that hard work and money doesn't go to waste.\r\n\"My drawings can not be removed from the car's body, even by water or washing with soap,\" she says.\r\nThis design has taken a week to complete.\r\nIts owner, Abd Allah Hossam, has opted for a striking all-black pattern.\r\nHe found Diab's work on Facebook and spent some time discussing ideas with her before they agreed on the final plan for his car.\r\n\"She showed me what she can do from her designs and I showed her other designs as well. And we managed to finish my car today,\" he says.\r\nNot all designs are as discreet as the one adorning Allah Hossam's vehicle.\r\nThis vivid pink and purple pattern was completed three months ago.\r\nIts proud owner comes to the car wash twice a month to keep the car looking its best.\r\nThe eye-catching design draws regular compliments.\r\n\"A lot of people stop me in the street to ask about the design as it is a new idea and not a lot of people have their cars made like this,\" says the owner, Amir Kamal. \r\nA lot of vehicles in Egypt are covered in stickers to decorate the body work.\r\nBut Diab insists her hand-drawn method is superior.\r\n\"The sticker is found everywhere and is imprinted directly on the car. But the drawing is unique,\" she says.\r\n \"There must be a difference because every drawing has its own soul.\"\r\nWith the day's drawing done, the young designer heads home.\r\nThis work provides money to cover her financial outgoings for now. \r\nBut she would consider leaving it behind for a stable job or a new business idea.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/e73dfb36fbad144d4e2d27fe764edbf4 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
