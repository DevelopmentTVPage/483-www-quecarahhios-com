    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Many visitors to the Statue of Liberty on Thursday were against a fundamental change in American immigration policy that has been recently proposed by the White House. \r\nMore than four million people a year visit the statue, one of the main tourist attractions in immigrant-rich New York City.\r\nOn Wednesday, senior White House aide Stephen Miller disputed the significance of a famous poem on the statue. The poem contains the famous words: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\"   \r\nMiller's comments about the poem, \"The Great Colossus,\" by Emma Lazarus, came in defense of President Donald Trump's proposal to dramatically reduce legal immigration and shift the nation toward a system that prioritizes merit and skills over family ties. \r\nMiller noted, correctly, that the poem was not originally on the Statue of Liberty. \r\nBut Lazarus' words have since been widely absorbed in American culture and helped make the statue synonymous with welcoming people from abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5a4e980fc23be1dcc78de10b356fcc7f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
