    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) A rescued green sea turtle named Picasso has been released back into the Gulf of Mexico, carrying the ashes of a Texas oceanographer who founded the rehabilitation center that helped nurse it back to health. Hundreds of well-wishers gathered Saturday evening to honor Tony Amos. Amos' wife, Lynn, his son, Michael, and other relatives sprinkled ashes on the turtle's back then watched it slowly flap and craw its way into the waves. Amos, 80, died of complications from prostate cancer on Sept. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/09c382dceb1271cbccb49d7f92d0742a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
