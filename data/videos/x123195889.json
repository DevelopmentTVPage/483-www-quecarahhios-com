But with Amazon's ever-growing retail presence is forcing  this small clothing store to take a hit.\r\n\"We've lost business due to Amazon,\" says the shop's owner, Mary Coleman.\r\nColeman says business was better before the rise of Amazon. She now spends her time browsing Amazon to stay competitive. \r\nIt has been difficult. \"I always want to make sure that my prices are competitive for my customers, and I can't compete on price.\"\r\nColeman says she's surprised, given that in her experience, shopping for clothing was a tangible experience. \r\nAmazon plans to make thousands of job offers on the spot at nearly a dozen U.S. warehouses. The hiring spree underscores Amazon's growth when traditional retailers are closing stores _ and blaming Amazon for a shift to buying goods online.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/b366dd35915a23de86e7b420adcb302b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
