We wanted to address this shortcoming,\" he says.\r\nThere's a mosaic that once covered a church floor in Jordan, and vases and goblets used by Christians long ago.\r\nBut the oldest item here is a third century fresco of Jesus found in the ancient church of Dura Europas in eastern Syria.\r\nCurator Raphaelle Ziade calls it the \"most moving piece, if not the most important of the exhibition\". \r\n\"This is the first time those frescos have been in Europe. And this is the real beginning of Christian images, there are not any previous images. So this is the first time we see a representation of Christ,\" she says.\r\nThe exhibition spans the Antiquity period, medieval times, the Ottoman era and on to more contemporary works. \r\nMany items are on loan from some of the biggest museums in the world she including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the British Museum and closer to home, the Louvre.\r\nMonsignor Pascal Gollnisch directs the L'Oeuvre D'Orient, a Christian aid association that has assisted in putting this exhibition together. \r\nGollnisch visited Mosul in July after it was liberated from the Islamic State group and his thoughts are with modern Christians from the region.\r\n\"If Iraq is going well, Christians from Iraq will be fine. If Iraq is taken to pieces, Christians will be facing threats and it will be bad,\" he says. \r\n\"We cannot talk about the Christian minority as if it were a bubble living its pains, or its serenity, separately from the country.\"\r\nThe exhibition runs until 14 January 2018.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1aaff03a9b639b2a3bc09341a04f7fca \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
