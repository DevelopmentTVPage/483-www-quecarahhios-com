    "description": "(24 Sep 2017) LEADIN:\r\nJordanian government, United Nations organisations and representatives from donor countries participated in a three-day workshop to discuss the funding needed to cover the annual Jordan Response Plan for Syria Crisis for the years 2018-2020. \r\nOnly 18 percent of the money needed for the 2017 plan has been received so far. Jordan hopes to receive two-third of committed funds from donors by the end of this year. \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nThese people are here for one reason - to tackle the Syrian crisis.\r\nThey've gathered at the Dead Sea to update the Jordan Response Plan - the framework that deals with the Syrian crisis - for the years 2018-2020.\r\nThe initiative aims to put this plan on the global agenda every year to generate enough funding where it is badly needed.  \r\nAnd Jordan's Planning Minister Imad Fakhoury says a lot more money is needed to reach this year's target.\r\n\"The fund registered for the response plan is still at the 18 percent, and it is low, but usually in the last four months of each year the numbers increase,\" he says. \r\n\"We've reminded the international community when they pledged at the Brussels Conference in April of the importance of having the same percentage of funds presented in the last year which is close to two-thirds of this support.\"\r\nJordan received 62 percent of the donors committed fund in 2016. \r\nThe representative of EU donors countries, Ibrahim Laafia, says donors are planning to give 1.3 billion US dollars. \r\n\"At this stage of the crisis, as complex as it is, we should be able to prioritise needs based on evidence, therefore a realistic prioritisation of needs based on sound assessment of results will allow donors and partners to focus on the most important priorities and therefore be more responsive.\"\r\nAccording to Jordanian officials, Jordan hosts 13 percent of the world's registered refugees. More than 1.3 million Syrian refugees live in camps and within host communities. \r\nAround 660,000 Syrian refugees are registered with UNHCR.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/29adbf1985db7aef220000dd780cdfa6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
