So the equipment was no longer needed in manufacturing, it was passed to this shop, and everyone who wanted it, bought it. I bought such things there.\"\r\nWhen Basargin found out about the opening of the museum, he decided to make dozens of his collectibles a part of computer history, picking them up off the dusty shelves and donating them to Skynet.\r\nYear by year it becomes more difficult to find old Soviet computers - most people have thrown out old hardware.\r\n\"We have several dozens of Soviet computers here,\" says Martyanov. \r\n\"Actually, there were a lot of various computers produced in the Soviet Union, and the engineering industry kept pace with the times, striving to replicate and improve exhibits, so to improve those developments from abroad.\"\r\nWhile computers today can fit in the palm of our hands, those of the past were a much larger operation.\r\nMartyanov switches on an old computer and the whirring of the fan starts up.\r\n\"There were five of those fans in a single cupboard. And there could be a few dozens of the cupboards in a big room. All of this was a single computer,\" he says, marvelling at the thought.\r\n\"The place where the computer was located was called a machine hall. You can imagine what noise was made by one cupboard and what noise was in a room where the computer was installed.\"\r\nToday, these old devices make today's users laugh: calculators were bigger than modern tablets and units looked more like chandeliers stuffed with lamps.\r\nEvery month up to 4000 people come to Skynet, most of them are students of local schools and colleges. \r\nThe most popular part of the exhibition is the gaming zone.\r\nThese youngsters are trying out video games.\r\nThey can't understand how people used the devices in the past.\r\nBut the gaming zone also features more up-to-date technology.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/43f1975ad52788238ea660ac4d6fe988 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
