    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) LEADIN: \r\nThe Romanian army has been demonstrating ballistic tests on a new bullet proof vest designed specifically for women.\r\nWomen had been making do with men's flack jackets, but the growing number of women in the ranks created growing pressure for vests that fitted better.\r\nSTORYLINE: \r\nA soldier takes aim at his target, the new women's issue bullet proof vest.\r\nThe new model has been remoulded using 3D scanning technology to take account of women's different body shapes.\r\nAs well as incorporating different bra sizes, the vest is shorter on the body.\r\nThe army says it wanted a good balance between protection and comfort.\r\nThe vest is wrapped around a female torso made from plasticine. \r\nWhen the vest is removed, the officer reveals that one bullet has managed to penetrate the model and this was where there was no protective shield.\r\nAccording to army scientists, the new vest has the same ballistic resistance properties of standard body armour.\r\nThe army is keen let everyone see the new vest being tested by ballistics experts.\r\nLieutenant Colonel Dr. Eng Claudiu Lazaroaie is the scientific researcher who led the project for the Romanian Ministry of Defence.\r\nHe says: \"This is a jacket with ballistic protection specially designed for women personnel, it is the result of an anthropometrical study. Cups were inserted into this vest. Women look different compared to men and men's flack jackets don't really fit. Furthermore, the jacket was designed to match women's body shape with a slightly narrower waist and slightly larger hips. The protection package is the same as for men's jackets.\"\r\nThere are approximately 3,500 female soldiers in the Romanian Army who could benefit from the new vest, according to the Ministry of Defence. \r\nSoldier Viorica Patrichie, of the special operations division Constanta, is one of them.\r\nPatrichie says: \"I initially tried a man's jacket which the Romanian Ministry of Defence used as standard issue comparison. This one here fits better on the body even though this particular one is slightly larger than I want. But still, it's better (than wearing a man's jacket).\"\r\nWomen have reported that men's vests are tight around the torso, making it difficult for them to move their hands, while the waist is usually too loose.\r\nThe vest costs about 10 to 15 percent more to manufacture than the men's standard body armour because of complications in the tailoring.\r\nThe Romanian Research Institute began developing the model in 2015 to meet an unsupplied demand.\r\nOther soldiers like Patrichie will be pleased to discover the army has learned that one-size doesn't fit all.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c27ec566b68c9da862e61f9f487b5932 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
