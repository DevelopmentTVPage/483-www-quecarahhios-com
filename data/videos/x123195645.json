    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) Police in Dubai have reopened the streets around one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers after firefighters put out a blaze that erupted early Friday in the high-rise, forcing residents to evacuate in the middle of the night and sending chunks of debris plummeting below.\r\nNo major injuries had been reported. A few people were treated for smoke inhalation, according to Dubai's Gulf News website.\r\nSeveral residents said the fire broke out just after 1 a.m. at the 86-story Torch Tower \u2014 a more than 1,100-foot-tall (335 meters) residential building in Dubai's popular waterfront Marina district. The same building had also caught fire just two-and-a-half years earlier.\r\nThe cause of the fire was not immediately known but in the past, such infernos in Dubai have been linked to highly flammable building cladding \u2014 as was the devastating Grenfell tower fire in London in June that killed at least 80 people.\r\nMore than 40 floors of the building on one side were engulfed in flames as residents looked on from below, many in tears. The firefighters battled the blaze for more than two hours.\r\nThe Torch Tower caught fire in February 2015; there were also no casualties reported in that blaze. Parts of the building were still undergoing restoration work when the second fire broke out early Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/93d37017a09d69fb7255a12dabdd9565 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
