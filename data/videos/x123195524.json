    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday called on the people of his country to vote \"in peace\" in next week's presidential election.\r\nThe race between Kenyatta, son of the country's first president, and opposition leader Raila Odinga, son of the first vice-president, has narrowed. \r\nBut there are fears that Tuesday's elections could again lead to violence. \r\nAn election official who oversaw the electronic voting system was found tortured and killed earlier this week.\r\nMore than 1,000 people died and 600,000 were evicted from their homes after what international observers called a flawed presidential election in 2007. \r\nBoth Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto, faced charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court after being accused or orchestrating the violence.\r\nHowever, the court dropped the charges, citing unprecedented witness interference and bribery.\r\nA government commission of inquiry found that deep-seated hatred over unresolved injustices and the belief that the court system was biased led to the explosion of violence - a pattern triggered by each election cycle.\r\nIn response, the government committed to reforming the police and judiciary and adopting a new constitution to check the president's powers. \r\nIt also established a Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission to deal with historical injustices.\r\nThough some changes have been made, Kenya has not reformed the police force, whose officers were found by the government to have killed more than 400 people in the 2007 unrest.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3f80d6ec35b77ba1499daefb90db3581 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
