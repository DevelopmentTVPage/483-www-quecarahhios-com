    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) A Massachusetts bakery's granola may be made with love, but federal officials say it shouldn't be listed as an ingredient on the package.\r\nNashoba Brook Bakery, in Concord, was taken to task by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for listing \"love\" as an ingredient on its Nashoba Granola label. In a letter posted this week on the FDA website, the agency said federal regulations require that ingredients \"must be listed by their common or usual name.\"\r\n\"'Love' is not a common or usual name of an ingredient, and is considered to be intervening material because it is not part of the common or usual name of the ingredient,\" the FDA wrote.\r\nThe agency said in a statement Wednesday that listing \"love\" as an ingredient was just one of several violations, including a failure by the company to clean and sanitize its baking equipment and facility properly.\r\nThe information about the use of \"love\" was included but is not among the agency's top concerns, the FDA said.\r\nThe bakery's CEO, John Gates, told The Associated Press the bakery will be \"fully cooperative\" with the FDA. He also said the bakery has a \"cleaning contract of $100,000 per year,\" along with a pest control contract.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/efdf1ce744ed51b93987788b60e04a38 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
