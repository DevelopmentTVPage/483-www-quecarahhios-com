The island has been coping with shortages of food, drinking water, electricity and various forms of communication after Hurricane Maria struck earlier this month.\r\nTrump said Tuesday is the earliest he can visit without disrupting recovery operations.\r\nHe says he may also visit the U.S. Virgin Islands.\r\nTrump says Puerto Rico is important to him. He says Puerto Ricans are \"great people and we need to help them.\"\r\nMeeting with members of the House Ways and Means committee, the president also said the new tax plan is all about simplification.\r\nThe plan is to be unveiled on Wednesday.\r\nTrump also said he is disappointed in the several Republican Senators who have announced they will vote against the current repeal and replace bill for the Affordable Care Act.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cac84910c72a83109a2f4bfbd02da63f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
