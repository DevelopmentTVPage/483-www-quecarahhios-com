    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) LEAD IN\r\nTimbuktu is still recovering from the damage done by a Muslim radical to their World Heritage sites.\r\nDespite a court ruling he must pay millions of euros in reparations, some say the damage is deeper than just structural.\r\n\r\nSTORY-LINE\r\nAhmadou Taghali, caretaker of the mausoleum of Sufi saint Alpha Moya in Timbuktu, works hard to clear sand from its entrance.\r\nIt was recently rebuilt, with the help of international support, after a Muslim radical led Ansar Dine militants to destroy it along with other World Heritage sites five years ago.\r\nThis summer the International Criminal Court ruled that the guilty man, Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi, must pay 2.7 million euros (3.2 million US dollars) \r\nResidents of Timbukto have welcomed the news, but some say that although money will help with the structural damage, the moral and spiritual harm will continue.\r\nTaghali, a descendent of Saint Alpha Moya says:\r\n\"I received the news about the reparations with mixed feelings. For me, the damage done was beyond the moral, it wasn't really just material.\"\r\nHe adds: \"I believe that even if there is a reparations payment, it shouldn't go to individuals. It should be used to improve the protection of and the restoration of the mausoleums.\"\r\nTimbuktu was famed for the reverence it gave to its saints and tourists once came here for spiritual peace.\r\nBut times have changed. Rubbish is now strewn around the mausoleum of Cheikh Sidi Ahmed Ben Amar. Locals use the site as a dump. \r\nThis started after Al Mahdi and his pickaxe-wielding rebels reduced the mausoleum to rubble, but is still continuing today.\r\n\"Today, what grieves me the most is all this rubbish,\" says mausoleum guardian Mohamed Maouloud.\r\nHe adds that he's been to see people, including the Malian army general Ould Meidou and Timbuktu regional council Ould Hamadi, to see if they can fix the problem.\r\nThe sites that were attacked were built during the 15th and 16th centuries at a time when Timbuktu was considered a great centre of Islamic learning. All but one of them was on the World Heritage list.\r\nThe Netherlands based ICC found that Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi had intentionally directed attacks against nine mausoleums and a mosque door in the desert city in 2012. \r\nProsecutors said Al Mahdi was a member of Ansar Dine, an Islamic extremist group with links to al-Qaida which held power in northern Mali at the time. The militants were driven out after nearly a year by French forces, and those troops arrested Al Mahdi in neighbouring Niger in 2014.\r\nThe ICC said the destruction of cultural monuments like those in Timbuktu: \"carries a message of terror and helplessness. (It) destroys part of humanity's shared memory and collective consciousness, and renders humanity unable to transmit its values and knowledge to future generations.\"\r\nAt previous hearings, Al Mahdi pleaded guilty and expressed remorse for his role in leading the destruction, urged Muslims around the world not to commit similar acts and was sentenced to nine years in prison.\r\nAl Boukhari en Essayouti, director of Timbuktu Cultural Mission, says hearing his remorse was \"a relief\".\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/82fa58f3e7fe29360d890a2d8d92fb5f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
