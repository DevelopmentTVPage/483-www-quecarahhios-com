    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Campaigners in Bosnia Herzegovina have painted a huge mural on a ruined dam in protest over the planned construction of 300 hydroelectric dams across the country. \r\nThe Coalition for the Protection of Rivers, representing over 20 eco-organizations in Bosnia Herzegovina, is calling for the construction of the dams to stop and for activity to be focused on the preservation of nature, tourism and traditional activities.\r\nCampaigners say that the uncontrolled construction of hydropower plants will cause devastation to biodiversity and water quality in the country. \r\nIn a symbolic action, a ruined dam on the Bascica River was painted with a mural of giant woman \"smashing\" the dam, meant to represent humanity's weakness over nature and the consequences of unplanned construction, campaigners say. \r\nThe mural was painted by Croatian artist Luka Tomac, one of the leading Balkan campaigners for preservation of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/76f0da481ab5468055cfcf4b20211122 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
