What admired me more about Diana wasn't that, was the way that she seriously attracted herself to those that really wanted her to do something and she did come back to the office and did make something work and was genuinely interested, this wasn't a job of work just to tick the box, oh I've been to that charity, she made things work, made people feel special.\"\r\nWharfe is a contributor to documentary, \"Diana: In Her Own Words,\" providing commentary on recordings of the late Princess made by voice coach Peter Settelen at Diana's Kensington Palace residence in 1992 and 1993, just after Diana and Charles separated.\r\nThe tapes were made to help Diana practice public speaking as she struck out on her own, and feature the late princess candidly discussing her personal life, commenting on their sex life, her fury at her husband's mistress and her love for another man.  \r\nDiana Spencer married Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, in 1981 and the couple had two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry.
