Cedric Richmond, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.\r\n\"We need the police to protect our communities, but we need fair and real community policing,\" he said.\r\n\"There's not anything wrong with protesting in an orderly peaceful fashion. I'm so proud, deeply moved by what the NFL players did,\" said Rep. John Lewis of Georgia. \r\n\" It is the ultimate form of patriotism to fight for justice, what they see, what we all see as wrong, which is the gunning down of black men by police,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington. \r\n\"In the end, what the NFL players did caused so many of us to feel tremendous pride,\" she said. \r\nMembers of the Caucus also criticized the Trump administration's response to the catastrophe following Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/80f7b76ebd590fddb0f526ad494a06f7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
