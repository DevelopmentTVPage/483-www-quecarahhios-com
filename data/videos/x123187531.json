    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) Ten of thousands of people waited outside Thailand's Grand Palace on Monday to pay their last respects to the late King. \r\nOver 11 million people have come to mourn the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej since he passed away on 13 October last year.\r\nThe number of people has increased dramatically this week after the Royal Household Bureau announced that this Saturday will be the final day that people would be allowed to pray in front of the Royal Urn at the Palace. \r\nThis group of mourners sitting behind the waiting line arrived at the Royal Plaza in the early hours of Monday and they are expected to wait until evening before it would be their turn to go in. \r\nThai officials said more than 64,000 people came to mourn their late King on Sunday.\r\nPreparations for the royal crematorium are now considered finished, according to General Tanasak Patimapragorn, Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister. \r\nThe design of the crematorium represents a mystical Mount Meru from Buddhist and Hindu legends where gods reside. \r\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn will preside at an official ceremony on 18 October to install the royal nine-tier umbrella on top of the structure, signifying the finishing of the crematorium. \r\nThe funeral will be held on 26 October this year.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/57698cc73a839e5fc3a2a0a3fcf1d8cf \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
