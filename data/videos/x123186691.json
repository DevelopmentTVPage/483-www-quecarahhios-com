    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Bali's gently-lowing cows, prized for their hardiness and doe-like temperament, won't become victims of the tropical island's menacing Mount Agung volcano if villager Wayan Sudarma has any say in it. \r\nA proud owner of 21 cows, Sudarma has been venturing daily into the no-go zone around the Indonesian volcano on a mission to rescue at least some of the thousands of cattle still grazing its potentially lethal slopes.\r\nExperts say that is highly risky. \r\nFast moving incandescently hot clouds of ash, gas and rock fragments that explosive stratovolcanoes such as Agung can expel would kill in seconds. \r\nBut Sudarma, who drives a past-its-prime truck into the so-called red zone to pick up cows when contacted by other villagers, said he isn't afraid.\r\n\"These are the only valuable belongings that are left in this situation,\" he said.\r\n\"That's why we have to save them, so they can sustain our lives as farmers and remain our pride.\" \r\nAuthorities set the volcano's alert status to the highest danger level on September 22 and warnings it could erupt anytime have sparked an exodus of more than 140,000 people.\r\nLeft behind, disaster officials estimate, were about 20,000 head of cattle. \r\nAnother 10,000 were sold or taken with communities as they left during the panicked evacuations that followed the order to evacuate a radius around the volcano that extends to 12 kilometres in places. \r\nLocal government officials say they hope the shelter Sudarma is bringing cattle to will save villagers from big economic losses. \r\nThose that sold their cattle in a rush, had to let them go for too little, they say.\r\nPredominantly Hindu Bali is known for beaches, surf, artistic culture and a lush green interior that lures millions of visitors a year. \r\nAnd while tourism is an economic mainstay, farming is still crucial for many.\r\nBali cows are particularly valued by villagers because they have high disease resistance, grow well on low-quality fodder and are temperamentally suited to close quarters living with people and ploughing.\r\nVeterinarian Wayan Gunawan, who has also been going into the danger zone to help with cow evacuations, said the shelter will also stop his district's cattle population from collapsing.\r\nThe vet admits to some trepidation about getting close to the cloud shrouded cone-shaped volcano.\r\n\"Deep inside, as a human being, of course we are afraid,\" said Gunawan.\r\n\"But this is our duty.
