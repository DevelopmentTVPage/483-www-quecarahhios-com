You try not to think about that at the time, your job is to stabilize and get them what they need and then move onto the next,\" she said.\r\nOfficials say a total of 60 people remain hospitalized at University Medical out of the 104 who were taken there. 12 people were still in critical condition Tuesday. Four have died.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/960ec986e368270f2eff1694942ea00d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
