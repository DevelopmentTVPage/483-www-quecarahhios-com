    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday addressed a major black law enforcement group, just days after President Donald Trump said police shouldn't be \"nice\" to suspects by shielding their heads as they are lowered, handcuffed, into police cars. \r\nThe comment, now described by the White House as a joke, angered some cops who said it only served to dial back progress they'd made with the people they serve. \r\nSessions did not directly address the president's comments, but said police officers need the support of the community as they do a dangerous job. \r\n\"You deserve the support and respect of every American, and I'm here today on behalf of President Trump and the Department of Justice to say, 'Thank you.' I am proud to stand with you. \r\nThe Department of Justice is proud to stand with you,\" Sessions said, drawing applause from the crowd. \"We have your back. We are in this together.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/459f3a1840fe856dd8071a78c5b3c1be \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
