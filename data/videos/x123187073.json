This Spring\/Summer 2018 Pret-a-Porter collection, shown at the Palais de Tokyo this afternoon, was no exception. \r\nEntitled \"After Nature,\" the show questioned the world and how we might improve the planet. It was an optimistic collection nonetheless-fun, urban and filled with bright color. \r\nWe are living in a digital age and the collection also expressed this fragmented vision of the world, with colored graphic prints, a mix of men's tailoring with cocktail dresses, and a surprising metallic pink and fuchsia.  \r\n\"I think the whole theme is very heavy and important for all of us so \"After Nature,\" it's like what we want with nature and how conscious we should be, what the future will be, it's in our hands,\" said Tuomas Merikoski.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/69a3a3bb2dd8853bff07cd59d4c11760 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
