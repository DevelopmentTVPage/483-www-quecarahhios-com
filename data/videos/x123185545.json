    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) LEADIN: \r\nRoad safety advocates say the latest technology in cars is a leading cause of distraction for many drivers. \r\nMost new cars now come with infotainment options to allow people to connect to social media, email, maps and text.  \r\nBut a new study says this is leaving many drivers distracted. \r\nSTORYLINE: \r\nThe infotainment technology that carmakers are cramming into the dashboard of new vehicles is making drivers take their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel for dangerously long periods of time, an AAA (American Automobile Association) study says.\r\nPast studies also identified problems, but the AAA says the \"explosion of technology\" has made things worse.\r\nAutomakers now include more infotainment options to allow drivers to use social media, email and text. \r\nThe technology is also becoming more complicated to use. Cars used to have a few buttons and knobs. Some vehicles now have as many as 50 buttons on the steering wheel and dashboards that are multi-functional. \r\nThere are touch screens, voice commands, writing pads, heads-up displays on windshields and mirrors, and 3-D computer-generated images.\r\nThe auto industry says the new systems are better alternatives for drivers than mobile phones and navigation devices that were not designed to be used while driving.\r\nJake Nelson, AAA's director for traffic safety advocacy and research says \"so these technologies have become more complex in that they allow drivers to do things that they couldn't do previously. Like in extreme cases interact with social media, search the Internet. But more common example might be to programme GPS navigation while also driving and in many vehicles today you're not able to do that. You have to programme your route before you hit the road. And that's of course what AAA recommends to do even if the technology is available to you to do it while driving.\" \r\nProgramming a destination into an in-vehicle GPS navigation system was the most distracting activity, taking drivers an average of 40 seconds to complete the task. \r\nAt 25 mph (40 kph), a car can travel the length of four football fields during the time it takes to enter a destination. \r\nPrevious research has shown that drivers who remove their eyes from the road for just two seconds double their risk for a crash.\r\nNelson says drivers testing all 30 of the 2017 model year cars and light trucks took their eyes off the road, and hands off the wheel, while using infotainment systems. \r\n\"One thing that was really surprising to me was that of all the systems that we evaluated 30 in this round. None of them allowed drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road for the duration of completing a particular task like tuning the radio that at some point in every process the driver is required to manually interact with the vehicle dashboard which usually comes with glances away from the roadway,\" says Nelson.\r\nThe test drivers used voice commands, touch screens and other interactive technologies to make calls, send texts, tune the radio or program navigation all while driving.\r\n\"We want drivers keep their hands on the wheel. We want drivers to keep their eyes on the road and we shouldn't provide vehicle controls and technologies in cars that could potentially encourage drivers to do just the opposite,\" says Nelson.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/78ea396d1e3da8cc21538c1d6205fe04 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
