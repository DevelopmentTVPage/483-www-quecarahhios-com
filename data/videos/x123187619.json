    "description": "(22 Sep 2017) The FDNY announced Friday it is collecting donations to send to the island residents of Puerto Rico. Donations can be made at eighteen firehouses and EMS stations throughout the five buroughs. \r\n\"Right now we are accepting donations everyday from seven o'clock in the morning til nice o'clock at night,\" Deputy FDNY Chief Bob Carroll, standing in front of a Lower East Side firehouse said, \"the donations include diapers, batteries, baby food, and first aid kit material.\"\r\nHurricane Maria, the most powerful hurricane to sweep across Puerto Rico in nearly a century, knocked out the entire electrical grid and telecommunications on the island, leaving many mainland families anxiously awaiting word on relatives back in Puerto Rico. \r\n\"Obviously in New York City we have a big Puerto Rican community that have plenty of relatives down there so anything we can do to help is good,\" Carroll said.\r\nMaria unleashed dangerous floods and mudslides throughout the territory and sent tree limbs hurtling through the air. Authorities confirmed at least six deaths but were still assessing the damage and trying to reach communities cut off by the storm.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6ff98786ee744628eb47520f106b85d2 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
