Murphy said, \"and It's because this country has the loosest set of gun laws allowing dangerous people to own dangerous weapons in the industrialized world.\"\r\nBut even as Democratic leaders pressed for action, none was expected, as other mass shootings in Colorado, Connecticut, and Florida, and even attacks on former congresswoman Gabrielle Gifford and congressman Steve Scalise, failed to unite Congress on any legislative response.\r\nA bipartisan bill on background checks failed in the Senate four years ago, and since then Republicans have usually pointed to mental health legislation when questioned about the appropriate congressional response to gun violence.\r\nThat 2013 legislation was proposed by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia.
