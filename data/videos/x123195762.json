    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) LEADIN:\r\nMen are queuing up to join an exclusive football league where losing is the whole point of the game. \r\nMembership to the national league called ManVFat, is restricted to overweight and obese men who enjoy football (soccer) and are serious about losing weight.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nIn most competitions, points mean prizes, but in this football league the pounds you lose can win you goals.\r\nMan V Fat was set up in 2016, by a group of men who believed there weren't enough fatloss schemes aimed specifically at men and too often they tended to be the minority in a zumba dance class.\r\nThis league is all about tapping into the competitive spirit where winning is everything, especially when it comes to regular weigh-ins. \r\nIt a sign of how dedicated to this scheme they are that these men will happily turn up after work to play in whatever the weather.\r\nThey don't need to play football well to qualify, but they have to have a body mass index (BMI) of 28.5. \r\nMost people who hit this band of body measurement will be unhealthily overweight, if not obese.\r\nAs well as performing well in the league, each team wins goals when they reach a target weight. Keep putting the weight on and your team mates will be dealt a penalty. \r\nAccording to the organisers, peer pressure and competition is a perfect weight loss combination.\r\nMost of the men who join aim to lose between five and ten per cent of their body fat.\r\nTerry Douding is project manager for ManVFat Football and he says the growth of the league shows they're on to a winning formula.\r\nHe says: \"I mean in the last eighteen months men all around the UK have been able to lose over thirty tons of weight and that is based on men losing one to two stone per season. Most of the men are loosing five per cent and many of them are losing ten per cent of their starting body weight and a lot of that comes down to the peer support from the other men and the coach. You know many of these men won't even be looking for new advice around nutrition, many of the men know what to do, but they need that accountability for change and turning up to a weekly weigh in with nineteen mates looking over their shoulder, knowing that it's the difference between winning, or losing the season, is usually enough for many of the men.\"\r\nWhen players join they fill in a detailed questionnaire which inquires about their goals and where they have failed in the past. \r\nDowding says: \"On week fourteen, from week nine in fact, we would begin encouraging clients to fill those surveys back in with those gradings we can get an idea of individuals's self improvement and in fact on the first pilot league, the first league that we piloted,  98 per cent of the league reported health improvements of some sort.\"\r\nEach team has a coach who will take details about their weight, health and diet before every match. The aim is for the men to play at least two matches each week. \r\nOrganisers say they already have sponsorship and support from some professional football teams.\r\nThe men who play here are supported by Leyton Orient a professional club based in east London.\r\nThe club ground is literally across the field.\r\nMan V Fat says the cost of joining is about twenty-five British pounds each month, which is on par with the cost of gym membership. \r\nIn some parts of the country membership is free, as the scheme is incorporated into facilities provided by local health authorities.\r\nMember Dave Worley says he's always had problems with his weight and when he left university and started working he had even less time to do exercise. \r\nMost of the men who come here say they enjoy football, but their weight makes it difficult to play in other leagues.\r\nPhilip Smith is the head of health and well being at the Leyton Orient Trust.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3cf2fd058bfc3c95c1db6cf7a168193f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
