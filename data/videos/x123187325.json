We passed our health care bill last May,\" Ryan said. \"So yes, we're a little frustrated that the Senate has not acted on a seminal promise -- health care.\" \r\nSpeaker Ryan is also promising help for devastated Puerto Rico, calling it a \"humanitarian crisis.\"\r\nHurricane Maria has left millions of U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico without food, water and housing. \r\nRyan said the $15 billion Congress passed early this month for hurricanes Harvey and Irma also applied to Puerto Rico.\r\nRyan also commented on the protests by NFL players to kneel during the National Anthem, saying \"people are clearly within their rights to express themselves how they see fit. My own view, though, is, we shouldn't do it on the anthem.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8ff3ee70991a193f081b89724137764f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
