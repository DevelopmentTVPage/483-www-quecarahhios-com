    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Friends and family of the missing arrived at the University Medical Center in Las Vegas on Tuesday, confusion and heartbreak in their eyes, as they continued to search for loved ones following a deadly shooting at a country music concert on Sunday. \r\nAt least some 100 victims are being treated at UMC after 64-year-old retired accountant Stephen Paddock shot and killed 59 and wounded 527 concertgoers from the 32nd floor of a Vegas hotel. \r\nA pregnant and emotional Desiree Albert, now on to her fourth hospital, was still searching for her uncle PJ Rott, who's been missing since the shooting at the Madalay Bay Resort. \r\nKris Delarosby flew in from Minnesota to help her friends in the search for Steve Berger.  Berger attended the concert with Charleen Jochim but got separated during the shooting.  \r\nEdward Leon drove through the night from Palm Springs, California upon hearing his niece had sustained gunshot wounds to the stomach.  An emotional Leon says the first surgery was successful, but it's a long road ahead.  \r\nAuthorities have not yet disclosed a motive for the attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1044760e8da169dfe902709740359e9f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
