    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) More than 140,000 people have fled the region around the Mount Agung volcano on the Indonesian tourist island of Bali, fearing it will soon erupt.\r\nThe disaster mitigation agency's command post in Bali said the number of evacuees has swelled to about 134,200 by Thursday evening. \r\nBut AP's correspondent in Indonesia, Stephen Wright, said on Friday that the number now exceeded 140,000.\r\nThat's more than double the estimated population within the immediate danger zone, but people further away from the mountain were leaving too.\r\nThose who have fled are scattered in more than 500 locations across the island famed for its beaches, lush green interior and elegant Hindu culture, taking shelter in temporary camps, sports centres and other public buildings.\r\nThe volcano has been at its highest alert level for a week, sparking the exodus. \r\nThousands of cows were left behind in the rural communities where farming is an important livelihood, but local animal husbandry officials were arranging trucks to remove them.\r\nThe exclusion zone around the mountain extends as far as 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) from the crater in places. \r\nWright said that there were hundreds of tremors daily on the island, with the crater venting vapour periodically, a sign that magma is still rising inside the volcano, he reported. \r\nThe local observatory reported a small plume most likely of water vapor after daybreak Friday, but no ash cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/58b20998f0ba409c51318ceb15150631 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
