    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) Iraqi government forces have retaken the northern town of Hawija from the Islamic State group, one of the militant group's last strongholds in Iraq, the country's prime minister said on Thursday.\r\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said in Paris that the fight against IS would now focus on the border zone with Syria.\r\n\"I want to announce the liberation of the city of Hawija today,\" he said, calling it a \"victory not just for Iraq, but for the whole world.\"\r\nPlans to retake Hawija had been complicated by political wrangling among the Iraqi security forces, Shiite armed groups and the Kurdish peshmerga troops. \r\nThe town is part of the Kirkuk governorate, which is disputed between the central government in Baghdad and the northern Iraqi Kurdish autonomous region.\r\nIraqi forces launched the operation to retake the town, which lies 150 miles (240 kilometres) north of Baghdad, late last month just two days after Iraqi forces began an offensive against IS holdouts in Iraq's vast western Anbar province.\r\nEarlier in the month, Iraqi and US-led coalition planes had stepped up a campaign of airstrikes on Hawija, targeting IS bases and weapons facilities.\r\nAlso in Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron offered France as a mediator between the Iraqi government and Kurds seeking independence after a controversial referendum.\r\nMacron made the offer after meeting with al-Abadi in Paris in wide-ranging talks about French support for the fight against IS and rebuilding Iraqi's economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/753725eb4c72e5e4c80914f255c5fd47 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
