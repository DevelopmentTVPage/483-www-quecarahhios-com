    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is in China for weekend discussions focused on trade and North Korea, along with preparations for an anticipated visit by US President Donald Trump in November\r\nHe is calling for a calming of the situation on the Korean Peninsula, but also says it is incumbent on North Korea to halt its missile launches.\r\nFollowing meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other officials in Beijing, Tillerson said he believes China has become deeply concerned about the North's missile and nuclear programs and is working hard to convince Pyongyang to re-enter talks, but did not say specifically what form those talks should take.\r\nAsked whether that should apply to recent pointed remarks from President Donald Trump, Tillerson replied: \"I think the whole situation is a bit overheated right now. I think everyone would like for it to calm down.\r\nTies between Beijing and Washington are considered more crucial than ever with the standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles entering a new, more dangerous phase as its leader, Kim Jong Un, and Trump exchange personal insults and threats of war with no sign of a diplomatic solution.\r\nTrump has been pressing for tougher measures on Pyongyang from China, the North's chief trading partner and source of aid and diplomatic support.  \r\nAlthough adamantly opposed to steps that could bring down Kim's regime, Beijing appears increasingly willing to tighten the screws on Pyongyang, and agreed to tough new United Nations sanctions that would substantially cut foreign revenue for the isolated North.\r\nTillerson reiterated Saturday that the U.S. would not recognize North Korea as a nuclear power, but said it also had no intention of overthrowing Kim's regime.\r\nIn opening remarks at his meeting with Xi, Tillerson said relations between the sides continue to \"grow and mature on the strength of the relationship between yourself and President Trump.\"\r\nEarlier, Tillerson told top Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi that a strong relationship between Trump and Xi bode well for dealing with political and economic differences between the two countries.\r\nTrump's visit, Tillerson said, also provided an opportunity to assess progress made between the sides since Xi and Trump met in April at the U.S. president's estate in Florida.\r\nThere they agreed to a 100-day plan for trade talks. After visiting China this week, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said there's been some progress, including a deal to let U.S. beef into China, but they need to tackle \"bigger things and more difficult things.\" The U.S. priorities are better market access, less protectionism and protecting intellectual property rights.\r\nTillerson is making his second visit as secretary of state to the world's No. 2 economy and chief American rival for influence in Asia, and increasingly, the world. Along with Xi and Yang, he met with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who told Tillerson that China-U.S. relations \"overall have a positive momentum and have arrived at an important opportunity to progress further.\"\r\nOn Thursday, Beijing ordered North Korean-owned businesses and ventures with Chinese partners to close by early January, days after it said it would cut off gas and limit shipments of refined petroleum products, effective Jan. 1. It made no mention of crude oil, which makes up the bulk of Chinese energy supplies to North Korea and is not covered by the U.N. sanctions.\r\nChina has also banned imports of North Korean coal, iron and lead ore, and seafood since early September.\r\nTrump's planned visit to China in November will come just weeks after Xi is expected to receive a new five-year term as leader of the ruling Communist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c8534897ae706c8c11dcbd9f790e839e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
