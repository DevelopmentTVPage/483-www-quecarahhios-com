    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) LEADIN:\r\nRefugee children, including those from Syria, who live in camps around Athens in Greece have taken part in a concert at the ancient Theatre of Herodes of Atticus.\r\nThe concert was part of the 'Athens and Epidaurus Festival' and was run by the Sistema Europe Youth Orchestra (SEYO), part of the worldwide music organisation El Sistema.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nThis young lady is about to have her moment in the spotlight.\r\nShe and some of the other children from Skaramagas Camp in Piraeus, Athens are getting ready to perform.\r\nThey are travelling by bus to the ancient Theatre of Herodes of Atticus, which sits next to the Acropolis in Athens.\r\nGamkin Abdo, a 12 year old boy from Syria, is going too.\r\nThe children sing on the bus and are happy and excited to be at the venue.\r\nInside Gamkin says singing and taking part in the concert makes him feel great.\r\n\"I feel good when I am going to the concert. Now I am going to a concert and it's good, and when I sing I feel better, I feel like something.\"\r\nThe concert is part of the worldwide El Sistema music movement.\r\nEl Sistema is a music education programme, which was initially founded in Venezuela, and has since spread to 55 countries. \r\nAccording to the El Sistema USA website, \"El Sistema is a tested model of how a music program can both create great musicians and dramatically change the life trajectory of hundreds of thousands of a nation's neediest kids.\"\r\nIn Greece the mission of El Sistema is to use music as tool for integration. \r\nThe El Sistema Greece programme started in November 2016 and offers a free music programme to refugees. \r\nFounder of El Sistema, Greece Anis Barnat says hosting the concert at the theatre brings people together.\r\n\"It's one of the most ancient theatres in the world, and here Athens is of course the birth of democracy. So coming here is very, very symbolic, We want to show that that all these kids from so many different origins, nationalities, religions, they can do something all together, and be in the same tune.\"\r\nBarnat says the orchestra and choir are tools the children use for wider learning.\r\n\"Music is only an excuse, but with music you can learn so many different things. You can learn mathematics, you can learn, languages, you can learn so many, many tools. You can have tools in your life that will be used as a citizen,\" he says.\r\nSistema Europe Youth Orchestra (SEYO) has 190 musicians between the ages of 10 and 20 as well as 30 music teachers from from 27 countries. \r\nOne of the conductors, Ron Davis Alvarez, is also the artistic director of El Sistema Sweden.\r\nHe says being involved in a choir and orchestra teaches a child many things.\r\n\"One of the important things when you have an orchestra or choir, it is a community. Inside of the community and through the music you learn values, your learn respect you learn how to listen and respect each other. So using the music as a tool for social development and for social integration like the orchestra, El Sistema Europe orchestra, (with which) we are playing today, I think is a good example of how we can communicate, how we can really help each other through music,\" he says.\r\nDavis Alvarez says he has a lifetime of El Sistema learning.\r\n\"El Sistema helped me quite a lot to have a better life. And when I see kids come, refugees that come from an other countries, escape from countries where there are a lot of problems and war, I can see the music can really help them to improve their life,\" he says.\r\nGamkin and the children from Skaramagas Camp sing enthusiastically in the choir.\r\nThe concert featured works by Handel, Brahms, Tchaikovsky and Beethoven, amongst others.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6addd69cb5e3e55eb22f23f908377c32 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
