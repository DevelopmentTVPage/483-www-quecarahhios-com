    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) LEADIN\r\nThe \"world's longest\" beer garden is opening at the International Beer Festival in Berlin.\r\nThe 2.2 kilometre-long festival, with over 2,400 different beers, is celebrating 20 years since the first edition of the festival.\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nIt's a traditional opening of any serious beer festival.\r\nThe taps are hit into the beer barrels with a wooden hammer.\r\nBut things don't always go to plan.\r\nHere at the International Beer Festival in Berlin, a few litres of beer were spilled before the second barrel was ready to be served.\r\nBut don't worry, there's enough beer here to keep a thirsty crowd content.\r\nIn 2011, the 2.2-kilometre-long festival was named the \"World's Longest Beer garden\" by Guinness World Records.\r\nBeer is serious business in Germany. \r\nEach German drinks about 100 litres of beer per year, according to the German Brewers' Association, making German's the fourth thirstiest beer drinkers in the world.\r\nBut it's not just German beers at the festival.\r\n\"I think that beer is not just important in Germany, but in the whole world,\" says beer festival queen Michaela Menda.\r\n\"And when you look at the International Beer festival in Berlin, you will see that it doesn't just unite people, but it unites the whole world. Celebrating together, drinking beer together, exchanging numbers. What other drink in this world can do that?\"\r\nThe first edition of the festival took place in 1997. That year, around 200,000 people visited the festival.\r\nThis year, on the 20th anniversary, organisers expect about 850,000 visitors to the festival, located on Karl Marx Street in the former east-side of the German capital.\r\n\"Visitors can expect the same thing that they have seen for the last 20 years and some more,\" says Menda.\r\n\"We have 344 breweries, from 87 countries, 2,400 different types of beer, all on 2.2 kilometres. \r\n\"That only happens at one place in the world and that is why we are in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest beer garden in the world.\"\r\nThe three-day festival also features music, dancing and food.\r\nThe Beer King of the festival is doing his best to sample as many beers as possible.\r\n\"International specialities on 2.2 kilometres, from 23 regions, with beer music on 19 stages,\" says beer king Eberhard Schollmeier.\r\n\"I can only say, a visit to the beer festival in the heart of Berlin will be worth it.\"\r\nThe festival is significantly smaller than the huge Oktoberfest, which takes place later in the year in Munich.\r\nBut according to the beer king, this festival stands out for another reason.\r\n\"Don't forget, there is only beer here,\" he says.\r\n\"It is the only festival like it in the world. No wine, no sparkling, no spirits, only beer.\"\r\nThe Berlin International Beer Festival opened 4 August and runs through 6 August.
