    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) More than a hundred buses carrying thousands of al-Qaida-linked fighters and Syrian refugees drove down a dirt road from Lebanon into Syria on Wednesday, in what was the last phase of an exchange deal between Syria's al-Qaida branch and Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group.\r\nThe departure of al-Qaida fighters from the Lebanon-Syria border comes three years to the day after its fighters stormed the Lebanese border town of Arsal and captured two dozen soldiers, killing some in captivity and releasing others. \r\nThe group's presence in Lebanon has left scores of people dead.\r\nMore than 7,000 Syrian refugees and gunmen, including a top al-Qaida operative in Syria known as Abu Malek al-Talli, were aboard the 113 buses that left Lebanon's Arsal region toward the Syrian border village of Fleeta, according to the Syrian government-controlled Syrian Central Military Media.\r\nThe militants and civilians final destination will be Idlib, the jihadi-held part of northwestern Syria, according to an agreement between Lebanon, Syria, Hezbollah, and Syria's al-Qaida affiliate. \r\nThat group is known as the Hay'at Tahrir al Sham militant alliance - Arabic for the Levant Liberation Committee - or HTS.\r\nThe long line of buses drove through the partially paved mountain road between the two countries as Hezbollah fighters in beige uniforms and carrying Kalashnikov assault rifles watched them drive by. \r\nMasked gunmen could be seen inside the buses on the road that was decorated with Lebanese flags and yellow Hezbollah banners.\r\nHezbollah combatants have been fighting along Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces since 2013, and the Iran-backed group is still deeply involved in Syria's civil war, now in its seventh year.\r\nThe evacuation deal followed a military offensive by Hezbollah fighters and Syrian troops during which they captured border areas between the two countries and left hundreds of al-Qaida fighters besieged in a small rugged mountainous area.\r\nThe fighting ended with a cease-fire on July 27 for negotiations to allow refugees, fighters, and family members leave to Syria's northwest Idlib province and the central Qalamoun region.\r\nThe three Hezbollah fighters were released shortly after midnight Wednesday by HTS in return for the release of three al-Qaida fighters who were held in Lebanon.\r\nAs part of the deal, the two groups on Sunday exchanged the bodies of their dead fighters. \r\nHezbollah handed over the bodies of nine al-Qaida fighters in exchange for the bodies of five of its own.\r\nThe al-Qaida faction will release five more Hezbollah fighters it is holding in Syria once the convoy of buses arrives in Idlib.\r\nThe large number of Syrians who decided to return home shows that some refugees prefer to head back to their war-torn country rather than stay in tent settlements in Lebanon. \r\nThe tiny Arab country is home to about 1.2 million Syrian refugees, or a quarter of Lebanon's population.\r\nThe U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, said in a statement that it is not part of the agreement that led to the latest evacuations. \r\n\"UNHCR is not in a position to ascertain to what extent refugees, who are civilians by definition, are returning in this movement,\" UNHCR said.\r\nWith the departure of HTS fighters from Lebanon, the Lebanese army is expected to soon launch an offensive on territories controlled by members of the Islamic State group.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/517c69bd744e0a2be87cf5d229cdf06d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
