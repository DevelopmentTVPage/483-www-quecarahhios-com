    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) LEADIN\r\nThe Matryoshka doll is one of Russia's most iconic souvenirs.\r\nOne of the best know versions comes from the town of Semenov where just one hand made doll takes 7 days to make.\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nA life-sized Matryoshka doll stands on a plinth. With her famous headscarf, rosy cheeks and long eye-lashes, the Russian nesting doll is recognised the world over.\r\nFirst made at the beginning of the 19th century the doll, which contains 6 smaller versions of itself, is a much loved child's toy and a popular souvenir.\r\nHandmade, no two Matryoshkas are identical. The word  \"Matryoshka\" is a diminutive of the female name Matrena, which comes from the Latin word matron, meaning \"mother\".\r\n\"Speaking as a whole the Matryoshka is the symbol of motherhood, it is the symbol of womanhood. Truly what today we call the 'Russian Spirit',\" says Alena Shapovalova, an historian from the Art History Museum of Semenov.\r\nThe Semenov Matryoshka doll is probably one of the best known of the dolls. Made by hand in the town of Semenov in the Nizhny Novgorod region it takes at least 7 days to make just one.\r\nIt goes through numerous hands during the process, from making to painting and polishing.\r\nThe painting process alone involves the painstaking work of several painters in three stages, each applying a new layer.\r\n\"The first artist applies the features to the Matryoshka doll, that means she draws the face, the hands, the headscarf, the Sarafan (traditional Russian\/ Slavic attire). The Matryoshka doll ends up looking like this. The next operation is taken up by the covering painter and she begins to cover the Matryoshka doll. Our traditional Matryoshka doll has a yellow headscarf and red Sarafan. Also we have this little pattern here we call the chessboard. It is our traditional trademark. After the Matryoshka doll has been covered and touched up, the next painter takes it up in her hands and begins to paint the flowers. She fills out the apron with flowers, so it looks like the Matryoshka doll is holding a bouquet in her hands and also the edge of the headscarf,\" explains Matryoshka painter Irina Kosterina.\r\nAll the hard work is definitely worth it as they continue to delight and intrigue tourists from all over the world.\r\n\"In the States we don't have them typically, you know,\" explains US tourist Jamie Fishenberry. \"So that is something, at least for Americans, we think of tourists, souvenirs, they are really common, very popular.\"\r\nMeanwhile Indian tourist Panjali Mukhaji says: \"If I am going back to my home I would like to take a Matryoshka from here because it represents Russia traditionally.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5defc5980f45b67c0a1e6c595faf3a2c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
