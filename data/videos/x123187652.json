    "description": "(22 Sep 2017) A young Afghan migrant says security in a camp for asylum seekers in Hungary was so strict that police escorted his pregnant sister-in-law to hospital to give birth.\r\nSeventeen-year-old Hamad Ahmadi and his family set off from Afghanistan nearly two years ago hoping Europe would greet them with open arms, but instead were met with razor-wire fence and heavily guarded camps.\r\nThey are among the hundreds of migrants this year who saw their hopes of a new life in a European Union country dashed by Hungary's tough anti-immigration rules as the once-overflowing eastern migration route into Europe has gone from a trickle to a drip.\r\nThe European Union border that saw hundreds of thousands of migrants enter freely in 2015 has since become a sealed fortress with two rows of fence and closed border camps that the United Nations have described as \"in effect detention centres\".\r\n\"There were too much police, night and day, 24 hours,\" Ahmadi said. \r\nAhmadi spoke in an interview in a migrant camp in neighbouring Serbia where the family had spent ten months earlier this year waiting for their turn to enter Hungary, and where they returned after Hungarian authorities rejected their asylum requests.\r\nWhile in Hungary, the large family - including women, small children and two newborn babies - stayed in a fenced camp with no freedom of movement for two months before they were told they must leave the country.\r\nHungary has faced strong international criticism for its treatment of asylum seekers, including erecting double razor wire fences on the border with Serbia, setting up the closed transit camps and limiting access to protection.\r\nThe UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi recently said Hungary is displaying \"a very clear intention\" to curtail the access refugees have to protection in the country. \r\nHe criticised the low number of refugees allowed to file asylum claims - five a day at each of two transit zones - as well as the \"very low rate\" of approvals.\r\nOfficial data suggest Hungary's harsh measures have succeeded in discouraging most of the migrants from reaching Europe this way, even as tens of thousands do arrive via the more dangerous Mediterranean Sea route or try another European country, such as Croatia or Romania.\r\nThis year, just 2,217 people sought asylum in Hungary, official data state, compared to 24,357 in 2016. \r\nOut of them, only 61 were acknowledged as refugees, while 383 received the status of a subsidiary protected person.\r\nWhile Germany took in the bulk of over a million asylum-seekers from 2015-16 countries like Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic or Slovakia have refused to accept them fueling east-west divisions in the bloc.\r\nAhmadi said his family's case was first rejected after just one month in Hungary but they were allowed to appeal. \r\nA government-appointed lawyer did not show up for the final court ruling which was delivered via Skype, he said.\r\nInside the transit camp, he and other migrants could move only within a confined area and had to file a request if they wanted to visit a friend in another barrack even for a short while.\r\nBut Ahmadi said that despite the lack of freedom, the family's hopes were high.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9a307dd42e8058fa45556ea0a5ca506f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
