    "description": "(28 Sep 2017) A day after President Donald Trump declared his displeasure with him, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price showed up Thursday to get a very public flu shot.\r\nPrice did not mention the controversy over his costly charter flights in his remarks at an event urging people to get vaccinated against the flu, and he left before a question-and-answer session with the media.\r\nTrump declared Wednesday that he's \"not happy\" with Price. Asked whether he plans to fire Price, Trump responded Wednesday: \"We'll see.\"\r\nA former GOP congressman from Georgia, Price played a supporting role in the fruitless Republican effort to repeal Barack Obama's health care law, which has been another source of frustration for the president. Price is known as a conservative policy expert, but his penchant for taking private charter aircraft on the taxpayers' dime is creating new headaches for the White House.\r\nLate Wednesday, Price's office said he's heard the criticism and has taken it to heart. There was no indication he would be stepping down.\r\nPrompted partly by controversy over Price, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday sent requests for detailed travel records to the White House and 24 departments and agencies, dating back to Trump's first day in office.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/473f39224b2bb2d355ce6351a0240d53 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
