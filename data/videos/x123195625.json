    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) In terse exchanges with audience members and the press on Thursday, Corey Lewandowski, President Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, repeatedly skirted questions surrounding his consulting and financial activities. \r\nLewandowski came to Ohio for a speech to the City Club in Cleveland and a fundraiser for a Republican congressman, Jim Renacci, who's a gubernatorial candidate with ties to Trump.\r\n\"I would love to see Jim become governor of Ohio,\u201d Lewandowski said.\r\nBut it's Lewandowski's relationship with a payday lender in Ohio that attracted the most attention. \r\nThe Associated Press reviewed a draft contract between his new firm and Community Choice Financial, which shows the company wanted to pay his firm 20,000 US dollars a month for advice. \r\nLewandowski said the contract was \"never executed.\" \r\nThe lender has been a leader in the industry's battles against government regulation, and in particular against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\r\nAt his City Club appearance, an audience member demanded that Lewandowski say \"yes or no\" whether Community Choice Financial is employing him.\r\nInstead of answering, Lewandowski said he doesn't \"make one dime\" tied to CFPB director Richard Cordray losing a job. \r\nThe skirting around the answer left audience members groaning. \r\nLater, he told reporters that Community Choice isn't currently a client, though he said he gives \"free advice, all the time,\" to lots of people. \r\nHe declined to name any of his clients.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/b4a579b4e2f203734f3090b825408c26 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
