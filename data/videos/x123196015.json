    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) LEADIN:\r\nGamers in Hong Kong who don't like travelling can now visit foreign countries with their very own VR travelling partner. \r\nThe VR Travel Friend is just one of the new gimmicks on display at this year's Ani-Com &amp; Games fair in Hong Kong. \r\nSTORYLINE\r\nA paradise for lovers of comics, gaming and animation, the Ani-Com &amp; Games fair draws fans in their thousands to the 5 day event at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. \r\nAlongside cosplay performances and a treasure trove of limited edition comics, games and figurines, fans are being treated to the latest in gaming and VR technology. \r\nThis is the VR Travel Friend - an app designed especially for what's known as 'otakus' - anime and comic lovers who hardly ever leave the house. \r\nThe app allows them to go on a VR holiday abroad with a companion of their choice. \r\n\"It was about so called 'Otaku', these apps are basically designed for them. It was tailor made for them to give them real experience instead of just on flat screen TV. It really gives them\u2026 I hope we can provide dreams for all the people out there,\" says app developer, Leonard Fong. \r\nGamers can tour the likes of Tokyo or Bangkok for as little as USD $6 per trip. \r\n\"I think what it is, is the people these days, they tend to like to stay home. Maybe they spend less money by staying home, they like to have the information through iPhones, So I believe this VR, with the people who like to stay home more, it really creates an imaginary world for them, but it's very real with these VR glasses on. We tried it ourselves, it's pretty real,\" says Fong. \r\nEric Cheung - a 30 year accountant visiting the fair is trying out the app for the first time.  \r\n\"This is the first VR game of its kind in Hong Kong. I can learn how to chase a girl. The VR device allows us to experience a realistic feeling,\" he says. \r\nGaming giant, Playstation has set up an area at the fair inviting gamers to compete and audiences to watch the live action.  \r\nVirtual reality is taking over the gaming world - on show today are new shooting, driving and sports games - all with a VR element.\r\nBut Playstation says live streaming is also enjoying a huge growth in players as well as viewers ahead of the Asian Games 2022 when e-sports will become an official medal event.\r\n\"I think there will be more people who never used to play games getting to know gaming. Because e-sport is not only for gaming lovers, it is also for people who like to watch gamers playing. Live-streaming is on trend now and it is an inseparable part of e-sport. The audience can learn more about gaming through live-streaming, I think this will be the biggest impact. Let's use Hong Kong as an example, in the past there were less people watching e-sports, but in this year there are more discussions on e-sports in the government and also in the industry,\" says Jacqueline Chiu, Assistant General Manager at Sony Interactive Entertainment Hong Kong. \r\nAni-Com &amp; Games Hong Kong is now in its 11th year. It runs  28th July - 1st August 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/2f3e7712951857863f6f6f6f7d52b9d5 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
