    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) US Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday defended President Donald Trump in the growing controversy over NFL (National Football League) players kneeling during the national anthem saying, \"it's a big mistake to protest in that fashion.\" \r\n\"I would note that the players aren't subject to any prosecution, but if they take a provocative act, they can expect to be condemned, and the president has a right to condemn them,\" he said. \r\nHe made the remarks following a speech at Georgetown University on free speech on college campuses. \r\nDecrying what he sees as political correctness run amok, Sessions said the Justice Department will support students who sue universities claiming their free speech rights were violated.\r\nIn declaring free speech \"under attack\" on college campuses, Sessions dove into an issue that has become a cause celebre for conservatives who argue their voices are being drowned out on college campuses as speeches by right-wing figures have been derailed by protests and threats of violence.\r\nDemonstrations erupted this week at the University of California, Berkeley, around a planned four-day conservative event dubbed Free Speech Week, which was suddenly canceled.\r\n\"The American university was once the centre of academic freedom, a place of robust debate, a forum for the competition of ideas,\" Sessions told an invitation-only audience, as nearly 200 students gathered in protest outside. \r\nA few others sat in the auditorium with duct tape over their mouths. \r\n\"But it is transforming into an echo chamber of political correctness and homogenous thought, a shelter for fragile egos.\"\r\nHe lamented what he described as a \"cottage industry of protesters who have quickly learned that school administrators will capitulate to their demands.\"\r\n\"Protesters are now routinely shutting down speeches and debates across the country in an effort to silence voices that insufficiently conform with their views,\" he said.\r\nAs he spoke, the Justice Department announced it would lend its support to a student who sued Georgia Gwinnett College, arguing his rights were violated when administrators limited where he could preach Christianity on campus.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/833677af4ed91d71b8ca22bc0c3b0f15 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
