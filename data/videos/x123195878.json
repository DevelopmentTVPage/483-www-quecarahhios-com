    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) President Donald Trump said he supports a bill that imposes sanctions on Russia Wednesday with foreign countries, disputing reports that he begrudgingly signed the legislation.\r\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee said the president was in support of such measures.\r\nThe legislation is aimed at punishing Moscow for interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and for its military aggression in Ukraine and Syria, where the Kremlin has backed President Bashar Assad. The law also imposes financial sanctions against Iran and North Korea. \r\nIn the most remarkable example of public Trump-bashing, Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona is taking aim at the president and his own party in a new book, writing that \"unnerving silence in the face of an erratic executive branch is an abdication\" and marveling at \"the strange specter of an American president's seeming affection for strongmen and authoritarians.\"\r\nThe criticism from Flake is especially striking since he is one of just two GOP senators facing competitive re-election races in next year's midterm elections, the other being Dean Heller of Nevada. \r\nAsked about the book, Sanders replied, \"Senator Flake would serve his constituents much better if he was less focused on writing a book and attacking the president and passing legislation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/23fee6c843d9911a470cda2dd73b120c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
