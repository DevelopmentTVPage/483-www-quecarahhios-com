    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) LEAD IN:\r\nAlexandria has held a special event to celebrate the ancient leader Cleopatra.\r\nActors paraded through the streets to bring attention to the sunken palace of Cleopatra which lies on the seabed of the city's harbour.\r\n\r\nSTORY-LINE:\r\nDressed in the costumes of their ancient ancestors, Egyptians parade through the streets of Alexandria.\r\nActors are playing the soldiers and handmaids of Queen Cleopatra, the last ruler of the Ptolemaic dynasty.\r\nThe legendary leader emerges, pulled past the crowds on a golden throne by her soldiers.\r\nThe event has been named 'Cleopatra's Dream' and it has taken a lot of effort to make sure this huge procession works like clockwork.\r\nActor Mahmoud Abd Elaziz plays the soldiers' commander.\r\n\"We did 17 rehearsals: ten in the studios and seven outdoors. It was not easy,\" he says.\r\nThe parade passes along the Alexandria Corniche, from the Citadel of Qaitbay towards the diving centre at the Eastern Port.\r\nThis event is being held to draw attention to the sunken city of Cleopatra in the sea around Alexandria. \r\nHundreds of lost antiquities have been found in Alexandria's coastal waters in recent years. In 2015, over 200 treasures from Ancient Egyptian times were discovered.\r\nIt adds to the country's rich history - something the actors have studied closely for their roles.\r\n\"We studied the things they used like jewellery and colours. For example the colour blue symbolises the sky, and they were always aiming for eternal life,\" says Shery Kamal, who plays a maid.\r\n\"We also studied other things like make-up and the importance of the scarab.\"\r\nThe celebration comes hot on the heels of World Tourism Day and has been organised in coordination with the Ministry of Tourism and the Tourism Promotion Authority.\r\nSince the uprising that toppled former president Hosni Mubarak in 2011, Egypt's tourism industry has taken a heavy toll.\r\nIn 2016, in an attempt to bring back foreign visitors, the country's Ministry of Antiquities announced a plan to establish what it dubbed the world's first underwater museum to showcase the submerged relics of Alexandria's ancient treasures.\r\nThe plan has not yet been carried out, but the director of today's show hopes events like this might help attract more visitors.\r\n\"We have created a street carnival that represents the dream of Cleopatra in order to activate tourism. We believe that there is nothing better than art to stimulate tourism,\" says Fady Nour.\r\nCleopatra boards her golden boat and heads out into the sea.\r\nThe ancient leader's palace and other buildings and monuments lie strewn on the seabed in the harbour of Alexandria, the second largest city of Egypt. \r\nSince 1994, archaeologists have been exploring the ruins, one of the richest underwater excavations in the Mediterranean, discovering around 6,000 artefacts. \r\nPerhaps this watery treasure trove could be the secret to bringing tourists back to the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/77d36ca8aa111070f3cc89cfd0ee906f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
