    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) A person familiar with an investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign says Special Counsel Robert Mueller is using a grand jury in Washington as part of the probe.\r\nThe person was not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Wall Street Journal first reported the grand jury.\r\nMueller was appointed special counsel in May following the firing of FBI Director James Comey.\r\nGrand juries are common vehicles to subpoena witnesses and records, though they do not suggest any criminal charges are near. \r\nMeanwhile, the Associated Press has also learned that President Trump's former national security adviser is now detailing previously undisclosed paid speaking engagements, business positions and income from the presidential transition that he left off his public financial disclosure.\r\nA person close to Michael Flynn tells the AP the filing shows Flynn entered into a consulting agreement with the British parent company of data firm Cambridge Analytica, which aided the Trump campaign. \r\nThe person says Flynn didn't perform work or accept payment under the agreement. He terminated it after Trump's election victory.\r\nFlynn reports earning about $28,000 from the transition and more than $5,000 as a consultant to an aborted plan to build nuclear power plants across the Middle East.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9799bd406ec92b0115cb322958a70088 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
