    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) LEAD IN : \r\nA winemaker in Italy is playing Mozart in his vineyards in the hope of finely tuning his next harvest.\r\nResearch shows the experiment might be bearing fruit. \r\n\r\nSTORY-LINE : \r\nThe wine harvest is underway in Tuscany. \r\nIn the \"Al Paradiso di Frassina\" vineyard, grape pickers work to the sound of Mozart. \r\nBut the music is not for their benefit.....it is for the benefit of the vines. \r\nThe man behind what is perhaps the world's most musical vineyard is Giancarlo Cignozzi, is a former lawyer from Milan. \r\nHe was the first \"vigneron\" to study the beneficial effects of sound frequencies on the plants, subjecting his vineyards to music therapy sessions based on the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. \r\nCignozzi founded his winery on an abandoned 10 acres estate in 1999, planting his first Brunello grapes between 2000 and 2001.\r\nHe started to play different kind of music to his vines. \r\nIn 2002 he was contacted by the department of Vegetal Neurobiology of Florence University, in order to  study the impact of playing music to cops.\r\nIt was decided that the best way to conduct the experiement was to concentrate on just one composer - and Mozart was selected because of his ability to write music centred on the 432Hz frequency, widely considered as the \"golden frequency\".\r\nAt the beginning of the experiment Giancarlo Cignozzi used 12 low budget speakers positioned in the corners of the vineyards then, in 2006, the late Amar Bose,an  American academic and patron of the Bose Corporation, decided to sponsor the project donating 86 of his finest speakers. \r\nThis allowed Cignozzi to split his vineyard in to sections and to test the results of different speakers.\r\n\" When the taster comes and asks \u2013Where is Mozart in the wine?-  I say you can't put the glass close to the ear and expect to hear Mozart playing his music! Keep in mind that Mozart is a procedure to help the vines to get more protection and grow healthier \" Cignozzi says. \r\nMontalcino is a stronghold of traditional winemaking. Federico Ricci, an agronomist and oenologist at Il Paradiso di Frassina, says  \"The procedure to use music in the vineyard was seen with a lot of scepticism in Montalcino, some smiled or made jokes at Carlo Cignozzi\u2026after years, they changed their minds\".\r\nMarco Pierucci is a freelance agronomist and oenologist. He hasn't worked with Cignozzi but he agrees that the use of vibrations and frequencies in agriculture might favourably influence crops.\r\n \"All the sounds produced by living creature are finely tuned, it's not possible for a human being emit a sound without all the harmonic frequencies, we produce proper chords even if we try to pronounce a single frequency. This is true even for animal life. Even in the life of parasites the are frequencies, and if we interfere with this frequencies, we can facilitate or disadvantage the life of this living creatures. Facilitate the vines and disadvantage the parasites.\" \r\n\"Al Paradiso di Frassina\" is a very small enterprise, less than ten acres of Brunello vines in Montalcino. \r\nMore than 50% of the production is sold in United States, the rest is destined for Northern European markets and some eastern countries like Poland and Ukraine. \r\nPreliminary conclusions from the University research team say that during their study in 2006 variations in growth were observed and total leaf area per vines was increased in the the sound treated vines, which also showed signs of more efficient leaf gas exchange. \r\nBut the scientists note that further studies are needed before any conclusions are drawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/542ca726313cebc7d93a814b60db0373 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
