The judge denied the request.\r\nThe prosecution phase of the trial is expected to last about two months, after which the judge will decide if there is a strong case for the women to have to mount their defense, said Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, Huong's lawyer.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/f925c963f0f048c16e2ebaf25c4e92f7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
