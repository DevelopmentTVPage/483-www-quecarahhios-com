    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) The infotainment technology that automakers are cramming into the dashboard of new vehicles is making drivers take their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel for dangerously long periods of time, an AAA study says.\r\nThe study released Thursday is the latest by University of Utah professor David Strayer, who has been examining the impact of infotainment systems on safety for AAA's Foundation for Traffic Safety since 2013.  \r\nPast studies also identified problems, but Strayer said the \"explosion of technology\" has made things worse.\r\nAutomakers now include more infotainment options to allow drivers to use social media, email and text. \r\nThe technology is also becoming more complicated to use. Cars used to have a few buttons and knobs. Some vehicles now have as many as 50 buttons on the steering wheel and dashboard that are multi-functional. \r\nThere are touch screens, voice commands, writing pads, heads-up displays on windshields and mirrors and 3-D computer-generated images.\r\nThe auto industry says the new systems are better alternatives for drivers than mobile phones and navigation devices that were not designed to be used while driving.\r\nBut Jake Nelson, AAA's director for traffic safety advocacy and research, said drivers testing all 30 of the 2017 model year cars and light trucks took their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel while using infotainment systems. \r\nThe test drivers used voice commands, touch screens and other interactive technologies to make calls, send texts, tune the radio or program navigation all while driving.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/05fd3f8adf3034d47fe8a8ec0acfef58 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
