These people fled Iraq after Islamic State militants attacked their community and now live in Greece.\r\nAround 450 Yazidis have gathered to mourn the dead and missing on this tragic anniversary.\r\nSixty-four year-old Barfi Khalil recounts horrifying stories of the extremists killing children and bringing them to their parents as food.\r\nAbout 5,000 Yazidi men were killed by IS when the Sunni militant group took control of Iraq's northwest two years ago.\r\nThousands more, mostly women and children, were taken into captivity.\r\nNow, the surviving community has been scattered far and wide. Some are in camps for the displaced in Iraq, others have left the country altogether.\r\nAround 1,000 Yazidis live in Greece.\r\nAnd at today's event in Nea Appolonia, 60 kilometres east of Thessaloniki, the banners and t-shirts show they are concerned their religious minority could disappear altogether.\r\nShekh Nouri Shengali, a Yazidi religious leader, calls the events of 2014 \"genocide\".\r\n\"We were murdered, we were persecuted, we were forced to leave our country. We didn't leave for a better life, not even from poverty,\" he says.\r\n\"We left because our country in the Middle East had disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6a26c951bd985276bb21ce51b50ce0a2 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
