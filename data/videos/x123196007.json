    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) LEADIN:\r\nWeary Spaniards in Madrid now have a place to go for an afternoon siesta - a dedicated nap bar has opened in the capital.  \r\nSiesta &amp; Go caters to people who work far from home and need a space to rest and relax during the busy working day. \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nAs the hot afternoon sun bears down, there's nothing more Spanish than an afternoon siesta. \r\nWhile smaller towns tend to shut down for a few hours in the afternoon, in the cities it's harder for people to find somewhere to lay their head. \r\nBut for those seeking solace from the sweltering summer temperatures, there's now a dedicated place for an afternoon nap in the heart of Madrid. \r\nSiesta &amp; Go opened in May, giving customers a quiet, cool space between 11am and 7pm every day. \r\nPeople can choose from either a bunk bed, private room or an armchair to relax. \r\nThere are 19 beds available and people can pay by the minute or by the hour. It costs eight euros an hour in a bunk bed and up to 14 euros for 60 minutes in a private room.\r\n iPads, newspapers, magazines or books are also provided on demand and and each client is given a fresh set of sheets and blankets.\r\nGraphic designer Philip Marco uses the service several times a week. \r\n\"I have always come a long way from home to my workplace. So everyday I feel tired, so siesta is a special way for me to get some energy back,\" he says.\r\nHe adds that a short nap keeps him refreshed for the long hours he works: \"I come for about 30 minutes, something like that. Sleep 30 minutes and that usually is enough for me to be able to get through the evening.\"\r\nDespite Spain's well-known tradition of taking a siesta, the business idea came about after the owner visited Japan.\r\n\"My boss went on a trip to Tokyo and realised that a siesta (bar) is a normal thing there. And so she wanted to implement it in Spain. And, well, what is more Spanish than the siesta,\" says Siesta &amp; Go manager, Johan Grillo.\r\nJapan is known for its capsule hotels and has many nap cafes. Many there believe getting short amounts of rest can make people better equipped for the rest of the working day.\r\nGrillo says many Spanish professionals are also waking up to the benefits. And he says he hasn't had any problem with customers overstaying their welcome.\r\n\"There are clients that say to me, 'Look, Johan, I need you to wake me in 30 minutes, 40 minutes, one hour, and I go and wake them. I always ask the customer, 'Do you need me to wake you?' If they say yes, I will go and wake them when they want. And if they say no, it's up to them.\"\r\nSiesta &amp; Go is located in the Azca neighbourhood, near the Nuevos Ministerios metro stop. It's surrounded by the offices of financial firms and large businesses, like Google, Deloitte and HSBC. \r\nCity worker Alvaro Huerta says he sees some benefit of having a siesta service. \r\n\"Here in Spain, I believe a high number of people take a siesta in the middle of the day. It's true that maybe in big cities people have less and less time or it takes a long time for them to travel home to take a siesta.\"\r\nJournalist, Ramon Bilbao isn't convinced it will be a popular option: \"In summer I'm not sure, because people work until three in the afternoon and then eat at home and take a siesta at home. In the rest of the year maybe.\"\r\n\"It's a Spanish tradition but I think that it's more of a legend than a tradition. Because, with the lifestyle we have, the working hours, the rhythm of life of that all Spanish workers ultimately have, you have very little free time for a siesta, in my case, at least during the week,\" adds finance worker Carlos Villarroja. \r\nIf you get tired during the working day, many doctors say taking a short rest can be beneficial. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/efa6ec5a983a45fe5c6a0974a7f719d2 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
