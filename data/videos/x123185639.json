I am with my camera and I have taken dozens of pictures of what I am seeing here. I know that the buffalo race is the only event in the world. It's a very unique one. And it's great. It's fantastic,\" she says. \r\nThe races are fun and festive, but jockeys take the matters quite seriously. \r\nThe animals go through months of training ahead of the event. \r\nThe buffalos are divided into five different age groups with total of 80 buffalo hitting the tracks. \r\nWinners from each group take a modest sum of 230 USD cash prize home. \r\nThe tradition of buffalo racing started about a century ago when farmers gathered to celebrate the end of the ploughing season and before the harvest.\r\nNirut Sutjarith, a buffalo owner says \"I am glad that the event is held every year so we can pass on this tradition to the next generations.\"\r\nAnother owner Suthep Theechitmachart, says he treats his animals like his children. \r\n\"I raise these buffalos like my own young children. They eat better than me. Sometimes I went hungry but had to find them good, find them grass, and take good care of them. If they are hot, I turn on the electric fans for them. I spent a hundred thousand baht (approx. 3,000$)  building the shed.\"\r\nAuthorities promote the race, in order to help keep the traditional farming methods alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/0e341f6c122f0dc33530796cafaf292a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
