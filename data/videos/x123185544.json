    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) Vice President Mike Pence kicked off the first meeting of the National Space Council Thursday by saying that \"America seems to have lost our edge in space, but those days are over.\" \r\nPresident Trump signed an executive order reestablishing the National Space Council in June, and the National Space Council will help the administration develop and implement long-term strategy and policy goals for space. \r\nThursday's meeting included testimony from witnesses representing different sectors of the space industry, such as civil space, commercial space and national security space. \r\n\"Just as with Sputnik six decades ago, we have resolved with the leadership of President Donald Trump to never again let America fall behind in the race for space,\" Pence said.  \r\nMany of the members of the National Space Council have been drawn from Trump's cabinet, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. Other members include Acting NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot and Deputy Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios.\r\nThe job of the council will involve coordinating all long-range space activities from commerce to exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/88b7c30f26f8f30390e857fbbd3bd1d2 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
