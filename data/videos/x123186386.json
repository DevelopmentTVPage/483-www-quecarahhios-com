They \"were able to peek inside our biological clock and elucidate its inner workings.\"\r\nCircadian rhythms adapt one's physiology to different phases of the day, influencing sleep, behaviour, hormone levels, body temperature and metabolism.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6fecb7bbd21f45a10ea39ca2771f59e0 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
