    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti, that has helped maintain order through 13 years of political turmoil and catastrophe, is coming to an end as the last of the blue-helmeted soldiers from around the world leave amid concerns that the police and justice system are still not adequate to ensure security in the country. \r\nThe UN planned to lower its flag at its headquarters in Port-au-Prince during a ceremony Thursday that will include President Jovenel Moise and other Haitian leaders, though the mission does not officially end until October 15.\r\nAfter a gradual winding down, there are now about 100 international soldiers still in the country and they will leave within days. \r\nImmediately afterward, the UN will start a new mission made up of about 1,300 international civilian police officers that will support as well as 350 civilians helping the country reform a deeply troubled justice system. \r\nIn addition, the various agencies and programmes of the international body such as the Food and Agricultural Organization will still be working in the country. \r\n\"It will be a much smaller peacekeeping mission,\" Sandra Honore, a diplomat from Trinidad and Tobago who has served since May 2013 as the final head of the UN mission in Haiti known as MINUSTAH, its French acronym. \r\n\"The United Nations is not leaving,\" \r\nMINUSTAH began operations in Haiti in 2004, when a violent rebellion swept the country and forced then-president Jean-Bertrand Aristide out of power and into exile and plunged the country into violent chaos. \r\nIts goals included restoring security and the shattered political institutions. \r\nIn April, the Security Council deemed the country sufficiently stable and voted to wind down the international military presence, then down to about 4,700 troops. \r\nMany Haitians have viewed the multinational peacekeepers as an affront to national sovereignty. \r\nUN troops are also believed to have inadvertently introduced he deadly cholera bacteria, have been accused of causing civilian casualties in battles with gangs in Port-au-Prince and engaged in sexual abuse of minors. \r\nBut the mission, with additional help from the US and other nations, is also credited with stabilising the country, especially after the January 2010 earthquake, and building up the national police force.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/981aa6da6b3d73b6855fb18eb6316b12 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
