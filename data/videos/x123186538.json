    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) A law prohibiting any kind of full face covering - known popularly as the \"Burka Ban\" - takes effect in Austria on Sunday.\r\nStrong support for it portends political upheaval in the 15 October national elections, with parties campaigning on an anti-migrant message poised to win and form a coalition government.\r\nSuch a rightward swing would have European Union-wide significance, not only ending what has been near-consistent governance by centrist parties in Austria since World War II but also strengthening the position of countries that have taken a hard line on migration.\r\nAnd with Germany's far-right and anti-migrant AfD party winning seats in the national parliament for the first time last week, any rightward turn in Austria would increase concerns among more moderate political forces within the European Union.\r\nThe law is known formally as \"Prohibition for the Covering of the Face\".\r\nIt applies to all coverings, including ski masks off the slopes, surgical masks outside hospitals and clown masks, except for costume parties. \r\nIt carries a maximum fine of 150 euros (nearly 180 US dollars) and police are authorised to use force with those resisting.\r\nBut its popular name reflects what most people associate with it - a paradox given that full veils remain rare in Austria despite the 2015 migrant surge into Europe. \r\nAnd Muslim community women leaders see arguments that it helps suppressed women as insincere.\r\nSupport for the law is strong, reflecting anti-Muslim voter attitudes that have put the parties fomenting such sentiments in front.\r\nThe two parties that critics link to anti-Muslim sentiment are the traditionally xenophobic Freedom Party and the People's Party.\r\nThe latter avoids the Freedom Party's inflammatory talk, but has swung radically from the centre to echo that party's positions on migration under its new leader, Sebastian Kurz.\r\nLeft struggling is the Social Democratic Party, even though it now is the majority partner in the government coalition with the People's Party.\r\nUnder Chancellor Christian Kern, the Social Democrats have been focusing on social topics and claiming success for Austria's recent economic upturn. \r\nBeyond his own liberal stance, Kern has no choice, with pro-migrant sentiment strong within the party.\r\nBut his message is not coming across well. \r\nA Unique Research poll of 1,500 respondents published on Thursday - with a 2.5 percentage point error margin - showed the Social Democrats with 27 percent support, ahead of the Freedom Party at 25 percent, but trailing the People's Party with 34 percent.\r\nAlthough the People's Party was part of the government coalition that opened its borders to more than 100,000 migrants in 2015, the party under Kurz now says that \"the political establishment failed in dealing with the refugee crisis\".\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/fe35b27c9ec4b540f70ed206c3a614e3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
