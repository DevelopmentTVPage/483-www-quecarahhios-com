    "description": "(24 Jul 2017) China's Foreign Ministry said today during a regular briefing that the standoff between China and India should not be called a territorial dispute, and said Indian troops should return to their side of the boundary.\r\nThe comments were made by spokesperson Lu Kang, who reiterated that China would not make any compromise on sovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nA BRIC nations' (Brazil, Russia, India and China) dialogue is expected to take place on the 27 and 28 July in Beijing, but China said withdrawal of the troops was a precondition for any meaningful talks between the two sides.\r\nWhile the two countries have exercised restraint thus far, heated rhetoric in both Beijing and New Delhi has raised concern over a renewal of hostilities that resulted in a brief but bloody frontier war between the sides in 1962. \r\nThe nuclear-armed neighbours share a 3,500-kilometre (2,174-mile) border, much of it contested, and China acts as a key ally and arms supplier for India's arch-rival, Pakistan.\r\nThe crisis is expected to be discussed when Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval visits Beijing at the end of this week for a security forum under the BRICS group of large developing nations.\r\nLu also said that people who enter China illegally should not be called \"refugees\", referring to a comment made by a UN body, on China's repatriation of North Koreans illegally entering China. \r\nHe added during the briefing that China firmly opposed nations, referring to the US, exercising a long-arm jurisdiction and applying domestic laws to other nations, in this case jeopardizing China's interest.\r\nLu said China opposes the use of military forces to solve the North Korea nuclear crisis, saying that it would only provoke an escalation and worsening of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/718be1697f05e6c7b65c5d5509a92b93 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
