    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) MARY J. BLIGE, CAREY MULLIGAN AND GARRETT HEDLUND BRING 'MUDBOUND' TO LONDON \r\nMary J. Blige, Carey Mulligan and Garrett Hedlund were in London's Leicester Square on Thursday night (5 OCT. 2017) for the premiere of \"Mudbound.\"\r\nDirected by Dee Rees, \"Mudbound\" is based on Hillary Jordan's 2008 novel of the same name.\r\nIt chronicles the lives of two families in the WWII-era South \u2014 one white and one black, and the complicated intersectionality of their paths. \r\nThere's the McAllans, Laura (Carey Mulligan), her husband Henry (Jason Clarke), his brother Jamie (Garrett Hedlund) and their father Pappy (Jonathan Banks), and the Jacksons, Florence (Mary J. Blige), her husband Hap (Rob Morgan) and their son Ronsel (Jason Mitchell).\r\nThey're tied together by a rental agreement \u2014 the Jackson's rent their land and home from the McAllans \u2014 and the deeply complicated racial relationships in the segregated South in which Henry can demand help from Hap at any moment and Pappy can insist that Ronsel exit the local store from the back entrance.\r\nIt's a sprawling and deeply American story about women, men, race and personhood that defies a simple summary.\r\nRees, who directed \"Pariah\" and the HBO movie \"Bessie,\" said it's a film that shows that \"all our narratives are intertwined.\"\r\nSpeaking at the premiere, Rees said she didn't set out \"with a message to educate people.\"\r\n\"But I am inviting people to consider their lives and to consider themselves and to consider their families because I think it starts with our own personal histories and so if you can interrogate your own personal history, then there's no way you can interrogate our collective history and I think this film demonstrates that.\"\r\n\"That's the beautiful thing about the movie,\" said Jason Mitchell. \"it's not bias, it's not trying to demonize white people or victimize black people or do any of that. You don't leave the cinema feeling I'm angry right now. It ends with love. It's a beautiful thing. And you get to see everybody's struggle and everybody's needs and their wants you know.\"\r\nMary J. Blige said she hoped the film would get its audience \"to think from other people's point of view.\"\r\n\"It will have us looking at each other and looking at ourselves like 'You know, we have a lot of work to do and we need each other to get it done. We need each other more than we know.'\"\r\nShe also described how she gave the role everything she had.\r\n\"Mary J. Blige is not in this film,\" she said. \"Florence Jackson is in this film. Mary J. Blige is playing a character by the name of Florence Jackson and I commit all and I give all to Florence. I let got of every piece of vain thing that I could think of so that this powerful, even more stronger than Mary J. Blige can live.\"\r\n\"Mudbound\" is showing as part of the London Film Festival.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/aa9a125309b6f91a43040e20b106a576 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
