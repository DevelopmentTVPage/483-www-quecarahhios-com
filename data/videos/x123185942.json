    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) US President Donald Trump handed out supplies on Tuesday afternoon at a church in Puerto Rico.\r\nAbout 200 local residents were gathered at Calvary Chapel, cheering Trump as he walked in. \r\nThe president shook hands and handed people flashlights and bags of rice. A few times, he tossed paper towel rolls into the crowd.\r\nSurrounded by a sea of cellphone cameras, Trump said, \"There's a lot of love in this room,\" and called those in attendance, \"Great people.\"\r\nAs he walked into the church, Trump told reporters the job that's been done on the island by FEMA and other responders, is \"nothing short of a miracle.\"\r\nTrump said Puerto Rico's electrical power is \"being fixed,\" adding that that the power grid was \"devastated before the hurricanes even hit.\"\r\nHe said lots of generators have been brought to the island and most hospitals are at least partially open.\r\nThe president has come under fire for what critics said was a slow response to the devastation. Maria wiped out power to Puerto Rico's 3.4 million people and left them short of food, water and supplies. At least 16 people died.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/85787735489de2cd8b5cbd8be315c0b7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
