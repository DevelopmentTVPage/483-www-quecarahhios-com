There's also a small cicada (insect), a micro-bacteria transmitting leafhopper.

The ear is underdeveloped and is either missing or weakened, so so we have a lot fewer of the noble parts of the plant that are the source of the essential oil,\" says Chaisse. \r\nThe situation is made worse by a leafhopper insect that carries phytoplasma, a bacterial parasite that attacks the plant tissue. \r\n\"The leafhopper is responsible for directly transmitting the phytoplasma disease. This illness sets in on healthy plants, infects them and grows into the plant, in the sap, slowly causing its death,\" Chaisse explains. \r\nPlants affected by the condition turn a pale green or yellowish colour and produce smaller leaves with no flowers, says Chaisse. \r\nThe deterioration of lavender plants started with a series of dry weather spells between 2003 and 2007, he says. \r\nThe region enjoyed more rainfall from 2012 to 2014, but drought hit the lavender again last year. \r\nA lack of rainfall during the autumn of 2016 and this past spring further exacerbated the situation, leading to a higher plant mortality, says Chaisse. \r\nTypical of Mediterranean areas, lavender historically plays an important role in the economy of Provence, with almost 26,000 producers directly or indirectly involved in the lavender industry.\r\nThe region is also internationally renowned for its production of essential oils obtained from the distillation of lavender plants.\r\nJean-Marie Naud is a farmer producing Lavandula angustifolia and lavandin in the village of Eurre, in southeastern France. \r\nNaud started cultivating the plant 25 years ago. \r\nIn order to preserve its purity, he says, he's adopted traditional methods that include harvesting by hand. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/86b868435c7b08d1c54e3e563235b446 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
