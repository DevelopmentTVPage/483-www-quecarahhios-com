    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Two judges appointed by Venezuela's opposition-controlled National Assembly have taken refuge in the residence of the Chilean ambassador in Caracas. \r\nChilean Foreign Minister Heraldo Munoz tweeted Tuesday that Beatriz Ruiz and Jose Fernando Nunez arrived \"in search of protection\" and said they have been offered asylum if they want it. \r\nRuiz and Nunez were among 33 judges sworn in on July 21 by the National Assembly in defiance of Venezuela's government-stacked Supreme Court.\r\nThe country's highest court quickly declared the appointments unconstitutional and said the judges would be illegally usurping power and betraying the nation if they tried to take their new posts. \r\nThe pair joins another Venezuelan judge who took refuge in the Chilean residence in Caracas. \r\nAt least three judges appointed by the National Assembly have been detained.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a06bd8520a5747ecabfd0c72818c9bb9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
