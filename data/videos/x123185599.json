    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Minutes into the playoff debut for these young New York Yankees, they trailed Minnesota by three runs. Their starting pitcher lasted just one out. A sellout crowd was stunned.\r\nCould their postseason be over almost before it began?\r\nNope. A strange AL wild-card game was only just beginning.\r\n\"We've had a quite a few games where we've gotten down early,\" Aaron Judge said. \"Just keep battling. Just stay calm. Just play your game, and good things will happen.\"\r\nJudge, Didi Gregorius and a brilliant bullpen rescued New York and lifted the Yankees to their first postseason victory in five years.\r\n                Gregorius' three-run homer tied the score in the first inning after Minnesota knocked out Luis Severino, a pumped-up Judge showed his most emotion this season when he hit a two-run shot in his playoff debut and the Yankees beat the Twins 8-4 Tuesday night. New York plays the Indians in a best-of-five Division Series starting Thursday.\r\n\"We're not done yet,\" Judge said. \"We've just got to keep it rolling in Cleveland.\"\r\n                Brett Gardner also homered for the Yankees, who chased Ervin Santana after two innings and once again eliminated Minnesota from the playoffs.\r\nChad Green, David Robertson, Tommy Kahnle and Aroldis Chapman combined for 8 2\/3 innings of one-run, five-hit relief, striking out 13 to tie the postseason record for a bullpen.\r\n\"It was just remarkable,\" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.\r\nTwins manager Paul Molitor marveled at the Yankees relievers and Girardi's use of them over 142 pitches.\r\n\"He extended some guys probably past their comfort zone,\" the Hall of Famer said. \"They still performed.\"\r\n                Brian Dozier led off the game with a home run and Eddie Rosario hit a two-run drive as the Twins burst to a quick lead.\r\nBut Santana went to full counts on eight of 11 batters, and he was removed after six outs and 64 pitches with the Twins trailing 4-3.\r\n\"It's the exhilaration of jumping out,\" Molitor said, \"and then the deflation of giving it back so quickly.\"\r\nMinnesota, the first team to follow a 100-loss season with a playoff appearance, lost its 13th consecutive postseason game, tying the record set by Boston from 1986-95. The Twins have been eliminated by the Yankees in five of their last six postseason appearances and have not won a playoff series since 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/2c89a3f69c543e047486aa8e567d38af \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
