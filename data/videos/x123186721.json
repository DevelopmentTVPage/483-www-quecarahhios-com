    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) China said on Friday that its order closing North Korean-owned businesses was in response to a United Nations resolution and should not be over-interpreted.\r\nChina stated on Tuesday North Korean businesses and ventures with Chinese partners would be closed, cutting foreign revenue for the isolated North under UN sanctions imposed over its nuclear and missile programmes.\r\nChina is North Korea's main trading partner, making Beijing's cooperation essential to the success of sanctions aimed at stopping the North's pursuit of weapons technology. \r\nChina, long North Korea's diplomatic protector, has however gone along with the latest penalties out of growing frustration with leader Kim Jong Un's government.\r\nNorth Korean companies operate restaurants and other ventures in China, helping to provide the North with foreign currency. \r\nNorth Korean labourers also work in Chinese factories and other businesses.\r\n\"We believe the resolutions of the Security Council should be implemented to the letter, without reservation and excess, \" said Lu Kang, China's foreign ministry spokesman at a regular briefing.\r\nHe added that China opposes any unilateral sanctions out of the framework of the UN Security Council.\r\nChina, one of five permanent Security Council members with veto power, supports the latest sanctions but doesn't want to push North Korea too hard for fear Kim's government might collapse.\r\nThe latest round of UN sanctions bans member countries from operating joint ventures with North Korea, most of which are in China.\r\nThey also ban sales of natural gas to North Korea and purchases of the North's textile exports, another key revenue source. \r\nThey order other nations to limit fuel supplies to the North.\r\nAlso on Friday China's foreign ministry encouraged the US and other parties involved in the nuclear issue of North Korea to send out positive signals in favour of a political resolution of the issue.\r\nThe comments came after the US acting assistant secretary of state for East Asia Susan Thornton cautioned Congress not to pass any legislation that would undercut the Trump administration's push for a diplomatic resolution with North Korea.\r\nLu Kang said China appreciates the US promise of \"Four No\" - no hostile policy twards North Korea, no intention to attack North Korea, no attempts to undermine or replace the government and no efforts to artificially hasten reunification of the peninsula.\r\nWe expect all the parties to show sufficient sincerity to accumulate conditions for dialogue and create opportunities for talks,\" said Lu.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/22c6b04d69e7a35360055abf6a5a13d9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
