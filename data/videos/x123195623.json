    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) In terse exchanges with audience members and the press, Corey Lewandowski, President Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, repeated skirted questions surrounding his consulting and financial activities. \r\nLewandowski came to Ohio on Thursday for a speech to the City Club in Cleveland and a fundraiser for a Republican congressman, Jim Renacci, who's a gubernatorial candidate with ties to Trump. \"I would love to see Jim become governor of Ohio,\u201d he said.\r\nBut it's Lewandowski's relationship with a payday lender in Ohio that attracted the most attention. \r\nThe Associated Press reviewed a draft contract between his new firm and Community Choice Financial, which shows the company wanted to pay his firm $20,000 a month for advice. Lewandowski said the contract was \"never executed.\" The lender has been a leader in the industry's battles against government regulation, and in particular against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\r\nAt his City Club appearance, an audience member demanded that Lewandowski say \"yes or no\" whether Community Choice Financial is employing him.\r\nInstead of answering, Lewandowski said he doesn't \"make one dime\" tied to Cordray losing a job. The nonresponse left audience members groaning. Later, he told reporters that Community Choice isn't currently a client, though he said he gives \"free advice, all the time,\" to lots of people. He declined to name any of his clients.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/0d76a8762042e83e4416e4571dd78a5c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
