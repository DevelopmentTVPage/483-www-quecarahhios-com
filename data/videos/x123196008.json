    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) LEADIN: \r\nDubai's justice system hopes its prisons can become true correctional facilities in the future, focusing on rehabilitation rather than punishment, by offering inmates a number of workshops and job opportunities \r\nSTORYLINE: \r\nThese inmates are putting their time to good use.\r\nToday is a handicraft workshop, and some good looking stuff is being produced. \r\nThe workshops at the Dubai Central Prison aim to provide prisoners with skills to help them find a job once they're released. \r\nOne of the inmates says the classes help him feel normal even though he's behind bars.\r\n\"The inmates benefit (from the classes) and it's a way to pass time, we don't even feel like it's prison. In the morning we come to work and then we go back in the afternoon, we feel like we're living normal lives outside going to our jobs and then going home.\"\r\nAuthorities say they pay the men a salary for their work; some use it to buy goods at the jail store, while others save up and send the money home.\r\n\"We gain experience and skills from these classes that are going to be beneficial to us when we leave,\" the prisoner adds.\r\nMen build everything from wooden boxes and dining tables to motorbikes. Some of these products are then sold in places like Carrefour supermarkets and on the Dubai police website. The prisoners get five percent of the sales\r\nOther rehabilitation workshops include painting classes, agriculture and farming, and a science lab where a number of men are building a machine to extract energy from the ground, using 3D printers.\r\nAuthorities say they also offer inmates opportunities to continue their high school education or study for a university degree.\r\nThe prison's Director says their rehabilitation programmes are meant to help the inmates even when they are released.\r\n\"Once an inmate completes the mechanical courses they will receive a certificate, it's an international certificate and not a local one, either from Japan or Korea. This will allow him to work in a garage or get a job at one of the accredited companies once they're out,\" says Brigadier Ali Al Shamali. \r\nHe says there is also support for inmates who want to start \"a small venture and make a living out of it\".\r\nAl Shamali says they work with inmates' families offering emotional and in some cases financial support.\r\nThere have been allegations of poor conditions, mistreatment of inmates and even torture at Dubai prisons. Al Shamali denies the claims, saying a team from the European Commission visited the Dubai Central Jail before the Emirate won its Expo 2020 bid.\r\n\"To be honest they were impressed by the services that we give to inmates and even their families,\" Al Shamli says. \r\nAP was not given access inside the holding cells of the prison.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/0a1e2013607622209fcdeeb4cda88269 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
