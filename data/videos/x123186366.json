    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) Iranians marked Tasua, a day before Ashoura, by holding public mourning processions on the streets of the capital Tehran and other cities around the country.\r\nThey commemorated the martyrdom anniversary of Imam Hossein, the third Shiite saint who was killed along with 72 of his companions the battle of Karbala in 680 AD.\r\nThe battle was against Yazid Bin Muawiyah, the second Umayyad caliph after Hossein disapproved of his caliphate as unlawful and refused to pledge allegiance to him.\r\nHossein and all of his supporters were killed in the battle and their women and children were taken prisoners. He is buried in present-day Karbala.\r\nBeatings chests with hands, hitting shoulders with chains and playing drums and other instruments in the form of parades are some of the rituals practiced by mourners.\r\nTasua and Ashoura are two of the most important religious days in the Iranian calendar that have been celebrated one way or another for centuries and play a central role in the Shiite faith.\r\nAshoura is the main day of mourning, which will be marked on Sunday 1 October.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/0b8c78d13e661b222e2e5b667e5499e5 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
