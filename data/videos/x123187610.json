    "description": "(23 Sep 2017) Sen. Bernie Sanders says more Republicans should take a cue from Sen. John McCain and oppose the party's latest proposal to overhaul the health care system.\r\nSanders is praising McCain's for using his \"conscience\" in opposing the plan, but says the struggle to stop the GOP bill is not over.\r\n\"Thank you John McCain. And John McCain has a conscience, and I wish very much that the rest of the Republican leadership had that conscience as well,\"\r\nSanders said at a nurses union event in San Francisco on Friday. \r\nSanders also touted his own \"Medicare for all\" health care plan in his remarks. \r\nThe Vermont independent is urging the nurses to show Republicans they will pay a \"heavy political price\" for backing any health care bill that eliminates coverage for millions of Americans.\r\nStill, Sanders says, defending President Barack Obama's health care overhaul law is not enough. He says Democrats must go further and back his plan to expand Medicare coverage for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/887cec1e54dfd233afcc1fecc637fdaa \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
