    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) New York \u2013 27 September 2017\r\n1. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif walking into interview\r\n2. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"I believe that we need to check our facts before we make statements.\" \r\n3. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during interview\r\n4. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"Well it worries me that people play with facts and produce alternative facts.\"\r\n5. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"Well I believe it is an insult to the entire Iranian nation and shows that the hollow empathy that he tried to show for the Iranian people is indeed hollow and not to be taken seriously and certainly the Iranians don't take that seriously.\"\r\n6. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during interview\r\n7. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"It is unfortunate that for irrelevant political reasons the President of the United States decides to alienate an entire nation and antagonize an entire nation who have not harmed anybody.\"\r\n8. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during interview\r\n9. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"Well you see, first of all it is not just Iran that is rejecting renegotiation. I think it was the unanimous view of all who negotiated the nuclear deal that renegotiation of this deal is impossible. It would open a Pandora's box.\"\r\n10. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during interview\r\n11. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"The message that the United States is sending to the world that whenever you negotiate with the United States whatever you agree in the course of the negotiations they take for granted and then they come back to you in 5 months, in 6 months, in a year, in two years to ask for whatever they could not get in the first round. This is not a good message to send to the world, this will prove that the United States is not a reliable negotiating partner and for a power like the United States to prove to the world that it is not a reliable negotiating partner is not good for international peace and security.\"\r\n12. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during interview\r\n13. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"It took us 10 years of posturing on all sides and two years of serious negotiation to reach this deal, I don't expect that a new round will produce any better results, in fact a new round will get us in a quagmire that nobody will be able to get out of.\"\r\n14. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during interview\r\n15. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"What is important is that if the deal is broken then Iran has many options, one of which would be to have a unlimited, but yet peaceful nuclear energy program.\"\r\n16. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during interview\r\n17. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n \"We believe that this referendum is dangerous for stability in the region and doesn't serve the interest of our Iraqi-Kurdish friends, that is why we have objected to it like every nation in the world.\"\r\n18.
