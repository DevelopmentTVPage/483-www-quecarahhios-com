Simpson to be released on parole as early as Monday from a facility near Las Vegas.\r\nNevada Department of Corrections spokeswoman Brooke Keast said Wednesday (27SEPT2017) the process and documents have not yet been finalized for Simpson's release after he spent nine years behind bars for an armed robbery conviction.\r\nKeast says Simpson remains at Lovelock Correctional Center in northern Nevada. She says he would be moved to High Desert State Prison outside Las Vegas for release.\r\n A close Simpson friend, Tom Scotto, would only say that Simpson is scheduled to be released ``shortly after'' Oct. 1. No one has said yet where he will live after he is freed.\r\n Oct. 1 is the date a state parole board set in July when it approved release for the 70-year-old Simpson.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/56eeb772570baefcbe7f40a720b6dcf9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
