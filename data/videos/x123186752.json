    "description": "(28 Sep 2017) Two Malaysian teenagers were charged with murder on Thursday after being accused of intentionally setting fire to an Islamic boarding school that killed 23 people, mostly students.\r\nThe accused boys are minors but prosecutor Othman Abdullah said he couldn't immediately provide their exact ages. \r\nBecause of their age, they will not face a possible death penalty. \r\nOthman said no plea was taken from the two boys and the magistrate set a hearing for Nov. 28.\r\nThey were among seven teenagers detained days after the Sept. 14 blaze for allegedly using cooking gas tanks and petrol to set fire to a dormitory on the top floor of the 'tahfiz' school, where Muslim students learn to memorise the Quran. \r\nThe blaze blocked the lone exit to the dormitory, trapping students behind barred windows, killing two teachers and 21 students from age 6 to 17.\r\nPolice have said the suspects sought revenge after allegedly being teased by some tahfiz students a few days before the fire.\r\nOthman said the two murder suspects, plus four other boys who were detained, have been charged with drug abuse. \r\nOne of the seven has been released due to lack of evidence, he added.\r\nPolice have said the school is also being investigated for flouting building safety rules. \r\nOfficials have said the school was operating without a fire safety permit and licence, and that a wall was illegally built on the top floor that blocked the victims from a second exit.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a162ec73931f8d601fd1032246dda195 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
