    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) The Italian grape harvest is having its earliest start in a decade, due to the effects of the summer's heat wave and drought.\r\nThe Coldiretti agricultural lobby said Italian wine production is expected to be 10 percent to 15 percent lower than last year due to weather conditions, which included in some areas an early bloom followed by late frost, while violent hailstorms struck elsewhere.\r\nBut Coldiretti stressed the grape harvest will be probably a very good one this year because the vineyards react to the heat by releasing more water leading to more concentrated sugar levels. \r\nThey therefore expect a smaller harvest than normal, yet a higher quality one as the heat also prevents fungi from developing.\r\nClaudio Faccoli, a producer in the Franciacorta area of Lombardy in northern Italy, said although the heat can be \"tedious\" the conditions are optimal.\r\nHis small family firm is at the slopes of Mount Orfano near Brescia, on calcareous soil and clay that is difficult to cultivate.\r\nMount Orfano is the oldest mountain of Franciacorta, composed of pebbles, red clay and limestone, turning into deep mineral notes.\r\nIt is a land of structured red wines: it is expressed in bubbles ensuring body and taste.\r\nThe Faccoli farm at present extends for eleven hectares (27 acres), five-and-a-half of which are devoted to vineyards dedicated to Chardonnay, White Pinot and Black Pinot.\r\nProducers of bubbly spumante in the Franciacorta area of Lombardy also start to gather grapes on Friday, 10 days before last year's harvest began.\r\nColdiretti has estimated two billion euros (2.3 billion US dollars) worth of damage to Italian agriculture so far this year due to scarce rain and drought. \r\nLast year, Italy produced 5.16 billion litres of wine. \r\nColdiretti said this year's production would depend on weather conditions in the coming months. \r\nThe harvest begins with pinot and chardonnay and continues into November with heartier red wine grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/f9f942d55cfe58010686b896481276d3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
