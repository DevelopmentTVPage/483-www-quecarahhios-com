    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) A suicide bomber struck a Shiite shrine packed with worshippers in a remote village in southwestern Pakistan on Thursday, killing 20 people and leaving at least 25 wounded, a provincial government spokesman and the police said.\r\nWithin hours, the Islamic State group (IS) claimed responsibility for the attack.\r\nThe bomber detonated his explosives vest when he was stopped for a routine search by a police officer guarding the shrine in the village of Jhal Masgi, about 400 kilometres (240 miles) east of Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province.\r\nAnwarul Haq Kakar, spokesman for the provincial government, said the death toll could rise further as some of the wounded remained in critical condition.\r\nMohammad Iqbal, a district police chief, said five children, a woman and one police officer were among those 20 people killed in the bombing.\r\nHe said they found body parts of the attacker and investigators were trying to determine who was behind the bombing.\r\nSarfraz Bugti, the provincial home minister, said \"terrorists have shown their inhumanity by attacking innocent civilians\" at the shrine.\r\nAtif Ali Shah, the custodian of the shrine, told reporters that had the attacker managed to enter the shrine, there would have been many more casualties. \r\nThe police officer who stopped the bomber and other guards who rushed to the scene \"saved many lives,\" he said.\r\nHundreds of devotees were present at the shrine for a monthly gathering when the bomber hit. \r\nLocal TV footage showed people crying for help in the immediate aftermath of the attack.\r\nJust hours earlier, Pakistani army spokesman Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor said the military had received credible reports of upcoming terror attacks. \r\nGhafoor told a news conference in the garrison city of Rawalpindi that the government has been alerted about possible attacks.\r\nThe claim by the IS affiliate in Pakistan came later on Thursday, in a statement posted on the Islamic State-linked Aamaq news agency.\r\nIS and other Sunni extremists perceive Shiites as apostates who should be killed and have carried out many such attacks in the past, targeting minority Shiite Muslims in Baluchistan and elsewhere in the country.\r\nPakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi condemned the attack, saying that \"terrorists have no religion\" and that his government will act against militants with full might.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/05ebeb443087e944a9d755f39074ad9b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
