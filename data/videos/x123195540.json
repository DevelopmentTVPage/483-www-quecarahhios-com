    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) LEADIN: \r\nThe heatwave wreaking havoc in southern Europe is set to continue with doctors warning that it's becoming a hazard to health.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nCountries across Europe are baking in record breaking temperatures.\r\nHere in Rome they've reached over 40 degrees Celcius.\r\nOutdoor workers have little respite from the sweltering temperatures here in Sarajevo, and emergency workers are warning people to stay indoors.\r\nDoctors are warning that it's not just the frail and elderly who are now succumbing to the relentless heat.\r\nDr. Tihomir Bera from Sarajevo emergency says: \"Even healthy people are coming here asking for our help. They are exposed to this extreme high temperature and high humidity. People are coming, mostly those wearing no sun protection, like a hat or a cap, people who don't take enough water, people who don't dress according to conditions outside - people should be wearing light clothes which helps the body to sweat, this is the only way for body to cool itself down. People suffer from strokes, and once they are brought here, they say - what can I do, I had to come out. Well, it should not be like that. I hope that in remaining days of the summer we will have less problems like that. So, instruction is for people to take their medication regularly, people should stay indoors, even close their windows. Look around, everyone is opening windows, and then the heat inside is the same as heat outside - 40 degrees, and then you can't really cool yourself off. \"\r\nDaily, temperatures in Bosnia are reaching record highs of over 43 degrees.\r\nThe local population is used to milder summers and there's now concern they could be in danger if the heatwave continues. \r\nAccording to Sarajevo Emergency medical services have been swamped with cases of heart failures and stroke in recent days.\r\nBera says that many too many people are ignoring instructions not to go outdoors during the hottest parts of the day. \r\nDoctors are urging construction companies to stop their employees from working outside during the midday peak. \r\nWhat has been surprising for medical staff is the increased number of healthy young people who've been taken to hospital emergency units.\r\nThe heatwave is travelling across to Europe from north Africa and according to weather forecasts temperatures are set to continue in low 40's until the middle of next week.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c8432825227d2095026fa1d8a5ff3d12 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
