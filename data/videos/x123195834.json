    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) North Korea's flurry of missile launches - 20 of them just in the past year - are a new and alarming fact of life for Japan and its other neighbours.\r\nBut Pyongyang's recent demonstrations of its capacity to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles, while worrying, are drawing shrugs from many in the region who reckon there's not much anyone can do about them.\r\n\"We have no idea when and where (a missile) would strike. Honestly, I don't think there is any way to prepare for it,\" Akira Fukatsu, a 65-year-old retiree, said as he sat drinking a beer on a bench in a park overlooking a US Navy base in Yokosuka, south of Tokyo. \r\nMany Japanese, South Koreans and Chinese appear to share that sense of resignation over North Korea's apparent newfound capacity to launch missiles capable of reaching much of the continental United States.\r\nThe 4 July firing of a Hwasong-14 ICBM, its first test, and another last weekend suggest that major US cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago are within range of North Korean weapons. \r\nSuch missiles could be armed with nuclear, biological or chemical warheads, although experts say North Korea hasn't mastered miniaturising them and might not have the technology to ensure a warhead would survive re-entry into the atmosphere from space or even hit an intended target.\r\nAttitudes in Japan, South Korea and China toward the threat vary, but likely reflect a sangfroid partly born of living with the legacy of the Cold War and ever present risks of huge earthquakes and other natural disasters.\r\n___\r\nJAPAN\r\nMany Japanese have mixed feelings about the latest developments, viewing them as a sign that by focusing on ICBM development, North Korea's aggression is directed toward the US rather than Japan, even if test launches have been splashing down off Japan's coast.\r\n\"Japan was within range of North Korean missiles even before their range extended recently,\" said Tetsuharu Nagashima, an official in charge of emergency response in Yokosuka, which is home to some of the 50,000 American troops stationed in US ally Japan, as well as a Japanese naval base.\r\nInstructions on the local government website tell people to take refuge in strong buildings or underground shopping arcades in case of attack, and to hit the ground and cover their heads if no such shelter is nearby.\r\nUnlike some communities that have held drills and drawn up contingency plans, Nagashima said Yokosuka had no plan to conduct evacuation drills.\r\nMisaki Honna, the mother of a 10-month-old girl, said suggestions that Yokosuka might be targeted because of the US and Japanese military presence were troubling.\r\n\"But even if we flee, we wouldn't know where to go. If a missile strikes, there's almost nothing you can do about it,\" she said.\r\nEiko Miyauchi, 83, endured US fire-bombings during World War II. As a child, she was evacuated from the coast and took shelter in an underground bunker as bombs rained down.\r\n\"I lived through the war, and I can't imagine anything being as scary as that one,\" she said.\r\n___\r\nSOUTH KOREA\r\nLiving just across the Demilitarized Zone from North Korea, South Koreans are famously laid back about its displays of military might.\r\nBut while life continues as usual and there's no visible panic on the streets, at least some South Koreans are starting to question whether North Korea's nuclear weapons and missiles may have become bigger problems than anyone wants to admit.\r\n\"South Koreans have been too relaxed,\" said Yang Seung-jun, noting that missile launches show North Korea could attack the South at any time. \"It's our choice to laugh it off and say 'North Korea can't do that,' or the 'United Nations will sanction them'... But war never happens when we expect it to,\" he said.\r\nStill, she does worry about the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3990ff84f9f7adabf957148be02b7010 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
