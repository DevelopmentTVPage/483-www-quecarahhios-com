    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) LEADIN: \r\nNot content with supplementing our own diets with vitamins and probiotics, we are now turning our concerns about gut health onto our pets.\r\nManufacturers of probiotic supplements for dogs and cats say sales are booming.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nIn California pets are getting used to something a little different in their food bowl.\r\nGrooming and wellbeing is no longer confined to a visit to the pet parlour, animal lovers are ensuring their pooches and pussycats get an internal makeover too. \r\nThe aim is to use probiotics to build a healthy intestinal flora and strengthen immune systems.\r\nThey're being widely prescribed by vets and more pet stores throughout Los Angeles are carrying several varieties of the products. \r\nThis is despite the fact there has been no clinical research that probiotics improve colon health in cat and dogs.\r\nProbiotics are now available in a variety of forms for pets, from powders to mix, capsules to add, chews to bite, or frozen for use at a later date.\r\nMany veterinarians in Los Angeles say there must be a balance for digestive and overall wellness, just as in humans.\r\nWith probiotics, the good bacteria go to the lower part of the digestive track and are supposed to ferment, while fighting off the bad bacteria.\r\nDr. Jeff Werber, President and Chief Veterinarian of LA's Century Veterinary Group argues probiotics are beneficial to a dog or cats overall health and help settle an upset stomach.\r\n\"Probiotics are beneficial to the gut flora. They seem to balance the bacteria in the gut and there are so many things that animals do and animals eat - medications that we as veterinarians give these patients that could upset that balance, inflammatory conditions, inflammatory bowel disease for example, any time of infiltrative disease can also affect the gut flora and upset that balance and therefore we see problems like diarrhoea\" says Werber.\r\nAt Pussy &amp; Pooch Pet Lifestyle Center in Beverly Hills, pet nutrition is part of the overall package of wellness, retail, grooming, day care, training and boarding services.\r\nCompany founder Janene Zakrajsek says: \"I think when it comes to probiotics anything that is considered a functional product i.e. functional treats. is a lot easier for consumers to wrap their heads around because it's a lot easier so they are not necessarily thinking it as an alternative to medicine, they're thinking it as something natural that they can do as a supplement, but by packaging it as something functional where it's combined with a treat or a chewable tablet or like a frozen yogurt or a goat milk these are ways of incorporating something that is healthy and beneficial in an easy way.\"\r\nStaff here curate their own probiotics.\r\nHollywood's Healthy Spot, an organic pet food and dog day care centre has pet probiotics on many of its shelves.\r\nHere, employees also see daily probiotic preparation no longer a problem.\r\nIts spokesperson Jade Lorain says there are too many processed pet foods marketing themselves as being healthy, but she believes the best foods are raw or mixed on the spot.\r\n\"The probiotics keep the bad bacteria from taking over their pets digestive system along with the enzymes that breakdown the food. We carry different products such as raw goats milk that have all 30 enzymes needed for digestive systems that you just defrost and pour into their daily routine with their food, along with tripe toppers that are little treats that you add into the food that are filled with probiotics and enzymes,\" says Lorain.\r\nHowever, Dr. Werber says not all probiotics are the same.\r\nHe believes some products which carry health claims on their label are adding substandard probiotics to their pet food lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8ba75866829dbc5268231c915fe2a0f9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
