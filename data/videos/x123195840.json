    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Lured by social media posts from people living in the Islamic State group's self-declared capital in Syria, the 17-year-old Indonesian girl called a family meeting of her parents, sisters and two dozen other relatives to propose immigrating there.\r\nEveryone found something in it for them: Free education and health care for the girls. Paying outstanding debts for her father and uncle, finding work for the youngest men. And the biggest bonus: A chance to live in an Islamic society that was apparently on the ascendant.\r\nIt didn't take long before their dreams were crushed and their hopes for a better life destroyed as each of those promised benefits failed to materialize. Instead, the family was faced with a society where single women were expected to be married off to IS fighters, and a raging battle in which all able-bodied men were compelled to report to the frontline.\r\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Nurshardrina Khairadhania, now 19, recalled her family's fateful decision to immigrate to the IS stronghold of Raqqa two years ago _ and how, only months later, their bid to escape began.\r\nDuring that time the family endured separation, her grandmother died after the arduous journey and an uncle was killed in an airstrike.\r\nShe now lives with her mother, two sisters, an aunt, three female cousins and their three young daughters in Ain Issa, a camp for the displaced run by the Kurdish forces fighting to expel IS from Raqqa. Her father and four surviving male cousins are in detention north of there. While the men are being interrogated by the Kurdish forces for possible links to IS, the women wait in a tent in the searing heat, hoping for the family to be reunited and return to their home in Jakarta.\r\nNur's family is among thousands from Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and the Middle East who chased the dream of a new Islamic society advertised by IS in slickly produced propaganda videos, online blogs and other social media.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/18b5029243e3fb3ebfd928661b7cf785 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
