We obviously have tents and we have refugee housing units but today we're sending the most essential covering to provide for the significant number of displaced that have been, people that have been moving into southern Bangladesh,\" Toby Harward from UNHCR says.\r\nWith camps becoming cramped, Officials from the UN refugee agency say they don't see an end to the crisis soon. \r\n\"We are responding to a mass-displacement crisis; 430,000 (refugees) is a significant amount of people and so far it has not stopped,\" Harward adds. \r\nRohingya Muslims have been escaping persecution and violence in Myanmar for decades. A mass exodus however began on August 25, with more than 430,000 fleeing Rakhine state. Troops responded brutally to an insurgent Rohingya group that staged deadly attacks on dozens of police posts. The UN has called the response \"textbook ethnic cleansing\".\r\n\"Essentially the refugee families who are already there have provided extraordinary first response to the newly arrived refugees, so the new camps, the camps that were there are really overwhelmed, we have refugee families taking in new arrivals, we have community centers, madrasas, schools filling up with new arrivals, and we're also, we're not able to cope so there's a large number of new arrivals who are outside the camps within the local communities,\" Harward explains.\r\nThe ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum has chartered all three planes for the airlift, while his wife princess Haya Bin Al Hussein has donated 1.4 million dirhams of core-relief items.\r\nAlso in a statement made today by a government official, Bangladesh is planning to build separate shelters for 6,000 Rohingya children who entered the country without parents.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6d81ffcbdf3f49f997914b4ba2606499 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
