    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) A Thai court acquitted on Wednesday two former Thai prime ministers and two other defendants of abuse of power over the deadly dispersal of a 2008 anti-government protest outside the parliament building.\r\nAfterwards Somchai Wongsawat, who was prime minister at the time, thanked the court and said he was grateful there was still justice in the country. \r\nChavalit Yongchaiyudh, who was his deputy and is himself a former prime minister, did not comment.\r\nThey both faced up to ten years to prison if they had been convicted.\r\nHowever the court ruling angered a small group of protestors, some of whom had been present at the incident in October 2008.\r\nHundreds of people suffered injuries during the pitched battle that developed when police tried to clear away protestors who were blocking entrance to the parliament complex. \r\nThey wanted to stop Somchai from delivering his first policy statement. \r\nTwo people died, though one of the deaths occurred away from the turmoil and were not due to police action. \r\nAt the time it appeared that many of the injuries were caused by out-of-date tear gas canisters that exploded after being fired, but in acquitting the men on Wednesday the judge said this conclusion could not be drawn.\r\nThe case was seen by some as part of an ongoing political vendetta against the powerful Shinawatra family. \r\nSomchai is the brother-in-law of Thaksin Shinawatra, who was deposed by a coup in 2006, and of Yingluck Shinawatra who was overthrown by the military in 2014.\r\nYingluck is facing a charge of abuse of power over a key government policy she instigated after her 2011 election, which resulted in heavy economic losses. \r\nA court will deliver its verdict in that case on August 25th.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/0f211865fa11a8c71095bba5fd68ae6a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
