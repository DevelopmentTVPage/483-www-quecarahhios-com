    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) LEADIN:\r\nIn the days leading up to the anniversary of the death of Egypt's president Anwar Sadat, visitors flock to an exhibition displaying artefacts from throughout his life.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nThe Sadat Museum in Alexandria has been open since 2009 and contains a wealth of objects related to the assassinated president Anwar Sadat.\r\nSadat was second-in command to Egypt's first president, Gamal Abdel Nasser, after the end of British colonial rule. \r\nLater, as Nasser's vice president, he took over from him immediately following his death in 1970. \r\nAfter fighting the 1973 war with Israel (alongside Syrian President Hafez Assad), Sadat became a leading proponent of peace with Israel, brokered by US President Jimmy Carter.\r\nBoth Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin won a Nobel Peace Prize for the Camp David Accords of 1978. \r\nVisitors to the museum can see a wide collection of medals and uniforms worn by Sadat, and pictures of him from all periods of his life.\r\nBut the main attraction is without doubt the uniform he wore when he was killed by Islamic extremists during a military parade in Cairo on 6 October 1981.\r\nMayar, a university student visiting the exhibition, is especially interested in the historic uniform.\r\n\"I liked that I learned new information about him, and there are pictures, and his military uniform, and I also liked seeing the last uniform suit he was wearing, and it was my first time seeing it. I came a few times to see this room.\" \r\nVisitors can also take a close look at a full size recreation of Sadat's home office.\r\nWith all of the different displays to take in, student and museum visitor Mohamed Reda has come to the exhibition three times already.\r\n\"I like to come see the uniform in which he was martyred, and his belongings, and everything, because I love President Sadat very much and because of that I come often to look at his things.\" \r\nMuseum manager Amre Shalabi explains that the exhibition had actually started as an attempt to bring all the artefacts together to put online.\r\n\"Before we founded the museum, we fought a battle to preserve and keep the archives which document his life in photographs, documents, and video, and audio, and to provide them all on the internet free of charge at Sadat.bibalex.org. That was the beginning, then, we moved to the second stage where we said, why can't there be a museum for President Sadat?\"\r\nThey were able to come to an agreement with Sadat's widow, First Lady Jehan Sadat, who allowed many personal objects to be displayed.\r\nShalabi says that it is the diversity of displays which keeps people interested.\r\n\"I think the museum shows a collection which helps people re-examine the history of Anwar Sadat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c9b85b80d800e57111d4154022b2d292 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
