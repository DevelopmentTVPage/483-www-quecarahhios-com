    "description": "(28 Sep 2017) A SELECTION OF ARCHIVE FOOTAGE FROM IN AND AROUND THE PLAYBOY MANSION\r\nHugh Hefner, who died Wednesday aged 91, ran Playboy from his elaborate mansions, first in Chicago and then in Los Angeles, and became the flamboyant symbol of the lifestyle he espoused. \r\nFor decades he was the pipe-smoking, silk-pajama-wearing center of a constant party with celebrities and Playboy models. By his own account, Hefner had sex with more than a thousand women.\r\nHefner bought the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles' Holmby Hills for $1.05 million in 1971, quickly turning it into a sexual playground.\r\nIn its heyday, the Arthur R. Kelly designed building was the scene of countless celebrity-filled parties and innumerable tales of sexual shenanigans.\r\nIn the 21st century, Hefner opened the doors to the mansion on cable reality show - \"The Girls Next Door\" \u2013 a reality programme in which the magazine kingpin starred with three live-in girlfriends. \r\nIn August 2016, Hefner sold the mansion for around $100 million (USD) to Dean Metropoulos, his next door neighbor. Under the terms of the deal, Hefner was allowed stay there until his death.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cb671cf4f8c05ce787c78ae1a2338571 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
