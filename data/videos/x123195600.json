SOUNDBITE (English) Shonda Rhimes, TV producer:\r\n\"Three things I think are beautiful: I think my family is beautiful, and I think my family is beautiful because they are a clear source of what is important in my life -- like, there's no way to get caught up in any of the trappings of what's glamorous or what's frivolous or what's ridiculous.  They are just pure love and they are beautiful for that reason.\"\r\nASSOCIATED PRESS\r\nNewark, New Jersey, 1 April 2016\r\n3.

SOUNDBITE (English) Shonda Rhimes, TV producer:\r\n\"Three: I think that activism is beautiful, and I think that anybody who's willing to sort of stand up and put themselves on the line for anything that they believe in that strongly is beautiful.  You know, I was watch...  I was watching Anthony Romero who runs the ACLU talk, and I got to say I think he is the most beautiful man on the planet simply because of what he's willing to do: those kinds of actions, those kinds of people who are willing to stand up and fight for people who can't fight for themselves, I find them absolutely beautiful. \"\r\nASSOCIATED PRESS\r\nNew York, 3 November 2016\r\n8.
