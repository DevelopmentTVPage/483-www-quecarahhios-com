    "description": "(28 Sep 2017) The federal government gave the media a first peek Wednesday at construction of prototypes for President Donald Trump's proposed border wall.\r\nCrews working on two of the eight prototypes moved dirt, with one of the crews also installing steel reinforcing bars before concrete is poured.\r\nEach crew gets only 60 square feet (18.2 square meters) to work on their prototype, prompting some to do assembly work elsewhere before moving the structure to their designated position.\r\nContractors have 30 days to finish.\r\nThe rectangular construction zone is fenced off from public viewing in a remote area of San Diego along the Mexico border.\r\nThe models will be tested for the ability to withstand sustained drilling with power tools and to deter crossers with anti-climbing features. They also must be aesthetically pleasing from the north side.\r\n\"Obviously, our agents will put it through the paces, and see, you know, techniques that other folks that are trying to cross the border have been trying to use, and see if we can defeat it, and test it.\" said Carlos Diaz, spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. \r\nThe government will consider the models to guide the proposed construction on the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200 kilometer) border with Mexico. Trump says he wants them to be see-through.\r\nFunding is a big question. The administration has requested an initial $1.6 billion next year to replace 14 miles of fencing in San Diego and build 60 miles in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings.\r\nDemocrats have balked at providing the money.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/d91330980590a87932dd2f9540e29bd4 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
