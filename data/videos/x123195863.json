It features 78 works by artists including Andy Warhol and Norman Rockwell dating back to the Civil War.\r\nCurators say it's the first comprehensive exhibit of football art by American artists.\r\nThe display comes ahead of the Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrinement weekend, which starts Thursday and is held annually in Canton. \r\nThe NFL was founded in Canton in 1920.\r\nFans and art lovers can see Polaroid pictures of O.J. Simpson, cereal boxes featuring Jim Thorpe and a painting of a scrimmage by painter and player Ernie Barnes.\r\nThe collection was first displayed in Colorado. It'll be in Canton until Oct. 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/95750b53cf581aacd88d5184e6a107d9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
