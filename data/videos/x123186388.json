And as a millennial, as a former mayor and a state legislator, I cannot afford a single-family home in a community that I work and represent,\" said Evan Low, a Calfornia state assemblyman representing Silicon Valley. \r\nBrown signed 15 bills outside a San Francisco affordable housing complex. \r\nThe bills include more money to build affordable housing and policies to speed up construction stalled by regulations.\r\nBut it will be several years before affordable housing units start popping up across the state and, when they do, they won't cover California's full demand.\r\nA 4 billion US dollar housing bond still needs approval from voters at the ballot box in 2018.\r\nThe 75 US dollar fee on real estate transaction documents created in another bill is expected to generate between 200 and 300 million US dollars a year - far less than the 1 billion US dollars handed out to communities through redevelopment funds Brown halted in 2012.\r\nThe money combined in the bills is expected to create up to 90,000 affordable rental homes in the next seven to 10 years, a fraction of what's needed.\r\nBeyond the money, other bills aim to streamline regulations that can slow down construction for a variety of reasons, including communities needlessly delaying projects they don't want.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/88d35730fbc8bade6e6a84776d7774e0 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
