    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Jerred Kiloh's eyes narrowed as he checked his rearview mirror while driving down a busy Los Angeles freeway. \r\nWas anyone following him? \r\nWith more than $40,000 in cash in the trunk of his car, Kiloh can't be too careful.\r\nI's a once-a-month nerve-wracking journey for the medical marijuana dispensary owner across town to pay his taxes. \r\nWithout access to banks, for the most part, because the drug is still illegal under federal law, dispensary owners must do practically everything in cash. \r\nThe constant threat of robbery is just part of doing business in California's flourishing medical cannabis industry.\r\nKiloh brings in about $15,000 a day at his shop. \r\n\"I think that most businesses in Los Angeles and all across the United States are able to pay their taxes with a bank account,\" he said. \"Our industry has been vilified that our funds that we only collect in cash are not able to hold bank accounts.\"\r\nBut come Jan. 1 when recreational pot becomes legal in the state, the emerging marketplace is expected to create a $7 billion industry, bringing in up to $1 billion a year in tax revenue and making it the nation's largest legitimate marijuana economy.\r\nPoliticians say that with so much money at stake, something has to give. They must find a way for dispensary owners to access banks.\r\n\"It is not normal for people to walk around with million of dollars in cash so we've got to deal with this reality and figure out a way to address that concern,\" said Los Angeles City Council President Herb Wesson.\r\nMany banks just don't want the risk of doing business with companies whose product remains illegal under federal law.\r\n\"They could technically be seen as aiding and abetting the commission of the federal crime of trafficking cannabis. It could be accessory after the fact,\" said Nicole Howell Neubert, a marijuana industry attorney.\r\nKiloh and other dispensary owners have just had to become their own banks, storing away hundreds of thousands of dollars in safes and vaults. \r\nMore than 50 security cameras scan his offices and hallways, keeping watch outside the building, as well.
