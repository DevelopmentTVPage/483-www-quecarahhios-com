    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) SAMUEL L. JACKSON, COMMON LOOK BACK ON HIGH SCHOOL \r\nSamuel L. Jackson was a heavy reader in high school - setting his sights early on life goals. \r\n\"I read a lot, you know, so I was always about getting away and figuring out, you know, where I was going to be in the world.  And through literature, I learned about places that I wanted to see,\" Jackson said.  \"I learned about things that I wanted to do and I pursued with a passion finding ways to achieve those goals.\"\r\nThe prolific 68-year-old actor spoke at a recent education-focused event in Santa Monica, California.  He said his early escape into the fantasy of books has become a daily gig. \r\n\"I escape every day, you know.  When I go to work, I am escaping.  You know, I don't have to be me; I can be somebody else.  I can pretend to do whatever.  But you know, being able to go places that I read about or finding myself standing in front of a statue that I had to identify on a test \u2013 that I used to ask myself 'Why do I have to learn this?  I'm never going to see this,'\" Jackson said.  \"And all of a sudden, there I am.  I actually tweeted this summer.  I was sitting in front of Vesuvius and I asked how many people... how many of you have had to identify this volcano on a test in your life?  You know, but I never thought I would see Vesuvius, but there I was.\"\r\nRapper-turned-actor Common also hit the red carpet at the event, alongside fellow musician Chance the Rapper.  Both grew up in the Chicago area and have donated heavily to the city's public schools. \r\nCommon says his mother emphasized the importance of education from an early age. \r\n\"My mother is a teacher.  She's a retired teacher and former principal \u2013 retired principal.  She instilled in me a lot about learning and discipline and how important education would be,\" he said. \"One of the things that I felt that I was able to pick up on and wished I had developed more is diversifying my education palette.  Like, learning a lot of different things.  And I also wish that it was more opportunities for me to try out creative things and try out, like, learning what engineering is or what the lighting director is or taking, you know, theater, you know.  Like, all of those things \u2013 I wish those things were more available, but I'm grateful to all the people that made time and took time to teach me.\"\r\nThe 45-year-old star of \"Suicide Squad\" and \"John Wick: Chapter 2\" laughed that he was fortunate not to have to attend a school where his mother taught or worked as principal. \r\n\"I ended up having to work there sometimes, like, during the summer, summer programs. I mean it's nepotism, I guess.  But you know \u2013 it was a public school, but I would end up working at her schools.  But I never had to go to her school.  That would've been really tough,\" he said. \r\nThe event was a one-hour telecast called EIF Presents: XQ Super School Live - intended to spur discussion about the state of high schools in the country and how they might be changed in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/885cce52bb160e260174d0cc8d3ace9b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
