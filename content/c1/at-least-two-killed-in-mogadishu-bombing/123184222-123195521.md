    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) At least two people were killed in an apparent car bombing on a major street in Somalia's capital late on Friday.\r\nPolice said two pedestrians were killed in the blast on Maka Almukarramah road in Mogadishu and five other people were hurt.\r\nThe exact target was unknown.\r\nThe blast came just hours after the US military confirmed that a recent airstrike had killed a high-level al-Shabab extremist commander blamed for deadly attacks in Mogadishu.\r\nSecurity forces had been on high alert after tipoffs of a possible attack by the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab. \r\nMost of Mogadishu's major roads were blocked and cars were being searched by soldiers before the blast.\r\nThe Somalia-based al-Shabab, the deadliest Islamic extremist group in Africa, often targets the capital with deadly bombings in high-profile areas such as hotels and military checkpoints.\r\nIt was the second time in a week that a deadly blast has rocked Maka Almukarramah road. \r\nOn Sunday, a car bomb exploded near Waberi police station and killed at least five people and wounded at least 13 others, police said. \r\nMost of the victims were civilians. The blast occurred amid a traffic jam while soldiers were searching cars at a nearby intersection.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/879e2499b8e1d1dce145dcd4bed87c57 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
