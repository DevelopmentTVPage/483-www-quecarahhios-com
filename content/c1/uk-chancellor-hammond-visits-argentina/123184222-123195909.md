    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie welcomed United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond to Buenos Aires on Wednesday.\r\nIt is the first time a British Cabinet minister visited Argentina for 16 years. \r\nHammond is on a four-day trip to South America. \r\nArgentina lost a brief but bloody war with Britain after Argentine troops invaded the South Atlantic archipelago in 1982. \r\nIn the biggest breakthrough in years, both countries recently announced that they would work to remove restrictions in the oil, fishing and shipping industries affecting the Falklands.\r\nThey also agreed to increase the number of flights between the islands and Argentina.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9746bc7669af44a9f8778e99e91cc958 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
