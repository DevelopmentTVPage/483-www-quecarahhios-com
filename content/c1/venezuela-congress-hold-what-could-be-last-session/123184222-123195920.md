    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Opposition leaders gathered on Wednesday for what could be the last session of Venezuela's National Assembly before it is replaced by the President Nicolas Maduro's Constitutional Assembly.\r\nMaduro has called for the inauguration of the new lawmakers on Wednesday. \r\nThey may enter parliament the same day or on Thursday. \r\nAs lawmakers arrived at the National Assembly on Wednesday, some reacted to the head of a voting technology company annoucning that the number of Venezuelans who participated in the election was inflated by at least 1 million votes in an official count.\r\nAn independent exit poll concluded turnout was less than half that reported by the election commission. Opposition leaders who stationed observers in every municipality also questioned the count.\r\nJulio Borges, the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, said lawmakers will ask the nation's chief prosecutor to investigate commission members for potential crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/42a093400a88fbafc695537cf93500a2 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
