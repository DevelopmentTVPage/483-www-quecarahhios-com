    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) Indonesian authorities on Saturday were trying to convince more than half of the 144,000 people who fled a menacing volcano on the island of Bali to return home, saying they left areas that are safe.\r\nThe Mount Agung volcano on Bali, a tourist hotspot known for its lush interior, Hindu culture and beguiling beaches, has been at its highest alert level for more than a week, sparking an exodus from an official danger zone and areas further away.\r\nAuthorities say the no-go zone, which in places extends 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) from the crater, is the area at risk of lava, lahars and searing hot clouds of ash, gases and rock fragments if there's a powerful eruption.\r\n\"Those who live outside the danger zone, we urge them to go back home and carry on with their daily lives,\" said Putu Widiada, head of the disaster mitigation agency in Klungkung district south of the volcano where some 22,000 people have fled. \r\n\"We are trying to identify those who lived outside the danger zone,\" he added. \r\nBali's governor has warned that people leaving what the government classifies as safe villages have become a \"burden\" on genuine evacuees and the temporary shelters set up to receive them.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6f2d8b89b38bd6eaf8d8063b4e54a2c0 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
