    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) Iraq's Kurds were voting on Monday in a referendum on support for independence that has stirred fears of instability across the region as the war against the Islamic State group (IS) winds down. \r\nThe Kurds are likely to approve the referendum, but the non-binding vote is not expected to result in any formal declaration of independence.\r\nInitial results from the poll are expected Tuesday, with the official results announced later in the week.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4872adb458379bcbf105b6957b463153 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
