    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Amazon is holding a giant job fair on Wednesday in New Jersey and plans to make thousands of job offers on the spot at nearly a dozen US warehouses. \r\nThough it's common for Amazon to ramp up its shipping center staff in August to prepare for holiday shopping, the magnitude of the hiring spree underscores Amazon's growth when traditional retailers are closing stores _ and blaming Amazon for a shift to buying goods online. \r\nNearly 40,000 of the 50,000 packing, sorting and shipping jobs at Amazon will be full time. Most of them will count toward Amazon's previously announced goal of adding 100,000 full-time workers by the middle of next year. \r\nAnd while Amazon has attracted attention for deploying robots at some of its warehouses, experts said it could take a while before automation begins to seriously bite into its growing labor force. \r\nBesides Robbinsville, New Jersey the event is taking place at Amazon shipping sites in Fall River, Massachusetts; Baltimore; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Etna, Ohio; Hebron, Kentucky; Kenosha, Wisconsin; Kent, Washington;  Romeoville, Illinois and Whitestown, Indiana. \r\nThe company is advertising starting wages that range from 11.50 US dollars an hour at the Tennessee location to 13.75 US dollars an hour at the Washington site, which is near Amazon's Seattle headquarters. \r\nAmazon is also planning to hold events for part-time positions in Oklahoma City and Buffalo, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/04b04882f36b7f76586ced64bc5ec119 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
