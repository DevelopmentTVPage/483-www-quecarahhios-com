    "description": "(24 Sep 2017) The massive exodus of Rohingya Muslims fleeing Myanmar to escape brutal persecution appears to have slowed down, but several recent refugees say at least tens of thousands more are huddled near beaches or in forests waiting to escape.\r\nSome Rohingya who have fled over the last week said Myanmar army soldiers were shooting at those trying to flee to Bangladesh. \r\nOthers said thousands were stuck in Myanmar because most boatmen had made the crossing to safety themselves and soldiers had burned many of the boats that remained.\r\nOver the last month, an estimated 430,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh as their homes and villages were set on fire by mobs of soldiers and Buddhist monks. \r\nThey have brought with them accounts of soldiers spraying their villages with gunfire.\r\nIn the first three weeks of the latest convulsion of violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state, tens of thousands of Rohingya poured into Bangladesh each day, walking for days through forests or taking rickety wooden boats on the rain-swollen Naf River.\r\nMany crossed into the country via the thin sliver of the Bay of Bengal that separates Myanmar from Bangladesh.\r\nBut Associated Press journalists have seen only a handful of people enter by land or sea at a few border crossings over the last week. \r\nHowever, there are several crossing points on the border between the two countries where Rohingya have entered over the last month, making it impossible to verify how many people enter Bangladesh each day.\r\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, also noted that the number of incoming Rohingya appeared to have dipped.\r\nOne man who fled Myanmar, Syed Noor, said on Sunday that tens of thousands of Rohingya were waiting at border points in Myanmar desperately trying to escape. \r\nNoor and his family had fled overnight into Bangladesh.\r\nNoor said other people from his village and other villages near the Rakhine town of Buthidaung were hiding in forests near the Naf River.\r\nNoor's excruciating journey took nine days and he said there was no food to be had for the last four days.\r\nAt first, the Myanmar army was targeting people and shooting at them and asking them to leave their villages, but now that the terrified villagers were hiding in the forests \"they are firing in the air to scare us,\" Noor said.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/db91f25b1a7bc71d363928125698bf25 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
