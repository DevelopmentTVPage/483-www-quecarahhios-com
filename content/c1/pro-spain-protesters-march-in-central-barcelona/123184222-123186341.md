    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) Thousands of Catalans marched on in central Barcelona Saturday afternoon defending the unity of Spain and against a disputed referendum on the region's independence that separatist politicians want to hold on Sunday.\r\nProtesters wrapped in red and yellow regional and national colours displayed a giant Spanish flag over their heads, as light rain started falling.\r\nThey chanted \"Don't let them fool you, Catalonia is Spain\" and slogans calling for regional President Carles Puigdemont to step down.\r\nSpain and its most powerful and prosperous region are headed for a showdown on Sunday with the planned staging of the independence referendum, deemed by the Spanish government to be illegal.\r\nAs eyes around the globe watch to see whether the region will actually try to secede from Spain, a country that has existed for some 500 years, the number of people who turn out to vote will be a key element.\r\nCatalan authorities have pledged to make the voting possible even if police, acting on judges' orders, manages to close polling stations and seal off ballot boxes.\r\nIf a 'yes' vote wins, they have promised to declare independence within 48 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/64f6d2ff9237aa286744fbc9fd16d0e4 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
