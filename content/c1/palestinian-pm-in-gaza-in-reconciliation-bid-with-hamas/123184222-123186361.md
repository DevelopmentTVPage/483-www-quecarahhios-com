    "description": "(2 Oct 2017) The Palestinian prime minister and a large delegation of Fatah officials travelled from the West Bank to Gaza on Monday in the most ambitious attempt to reconcile with the rival Hamas militant group after a ten-year rift. \r\nMinutes after entering the coastal territory, Rami Hamdallah told a crowd of Fatah and Hamas officials that national unity was the only way to achieve statehood.\r\nIn a significant concession, Hamas has offered to turn over all governing responsibilities to Hamdallah. \r\nBut key sticking points, primarily Hamas' refusal to disarm its powerful military wing, are likely to complicate or even derail the reconciliation efforts in the coming weeks.\r\nHamas won the legislative elections in 2006 and the following year seized control of Gaza after overrunning the Fatah-led forces of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. \r\nSince then, Abbas' Palestinian Authority has governed only in autonomous enclaves of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, while repeated attempts to reconcile with Hamas have failed. Hamas have not held elections since. \r\nIn previous deals, including one brokered by Egypt in 2011, both sides professed willingness to reconcile, but ultimately balked at giving up power in their respective territories. \r\nPast reconciliation attempts fumbled because of Israeli and international demands for Hamas to disarm, renounce violence and recognise Israel's right to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/dd0b67c817b4788758910d33a8068284 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
