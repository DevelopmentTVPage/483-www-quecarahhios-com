    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Three researchers based in the U.S., U.K. and Switzerland won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday for developments in electron microscopy. \r\nOne of the winners, Joachim Frank developed a method to generate three-dimensional images of the molecules of life.\r\nFrank said the method, called cryo-electron microscopy, meant medicine no longer focuses on organs but looks at the processes in the cell.\r\nFrank, who teaches at New York's Columbia University, shares the 9-million-kronor ($1.1 million) prize with Jacques Dubochet of the University of Lausanne and Richard Henderson of MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/d40def690724842734168b27e9eb05d8 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
