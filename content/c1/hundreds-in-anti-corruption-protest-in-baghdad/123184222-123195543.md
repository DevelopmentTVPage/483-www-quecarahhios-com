    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) Hundreds of protesters heeded a call by Iraq's leading Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr on Friday and took to the streets of Baghdad for a mass rally against corruption.\r\nAl-Sadr's call came two days after parliament passed 21 articles of draft plans for the provincial elections, slated for 2018. \r\nA statement issued by the cleric's office accused \"corrupt politicians\" of planning to install a new electoral commission and to approve an election law aimed at serving the interests of the \"same old\" large parliamentary blocs. \r\nThe rally in Tahrir Square attracted thousands of protesters, who waved Iraqi flags and chanted anti-government slogans.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c8d9e43704b18199d95f4221f5ac0c45 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
