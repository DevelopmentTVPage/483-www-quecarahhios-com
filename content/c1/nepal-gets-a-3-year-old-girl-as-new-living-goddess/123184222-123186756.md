    "description": "(28 Sep 2017) A three-year-old girl has become the latest Living goddess in Nepal, revered by both Hindus and Buddhists in the Himalayan nation.\r\nTrishna Shakya was carried to the temple palace in the heart of the Nepalese capital on Thursday amid a religious ceremony where she will spend many years just before puberty.\r\nShe was among the four final contestants from the Shakya clan for the position of the living goddess locally called Kumari.\r\nTrishna's predecessor Matina Shakya left the temple palace soon after she entered from a rear entrance on a palanquin carried by her family and supporters.\r\nThe ceremony took place on the eighth day of the two-week long Dasain festival, the main festival in Nepal.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/69bbce71a113f578abf920a8e9d5b1d7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
