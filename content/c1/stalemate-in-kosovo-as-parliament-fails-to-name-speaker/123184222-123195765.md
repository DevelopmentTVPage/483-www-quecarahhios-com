    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Kosovo's 120 new lawmakers were sworn in Prishtina on Thursday, but the election of a parliamentary speaker was delayed amid doubts that the winning coalition from June's election can muster a majority vote.\r\nThe choice for the speaker is important because it will indicate if the coalition, which includes former leaders of Kosovo's war of independence against Serbia, can secure the required votes to also choose the new prime minister.\r\nThe coalition, headed by incumbent speaker Kadri Veseli, won 39 seats in parliament in the 11 June election. \r\nIt will need backing from other political groupings or persuade individual lawmakers to support it.\r\nParliament will reconvene on Friday to take up the issue.\r\nKosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, which is not recognised by Belgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/f0679e43155a6698084199c8f20a00f9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
