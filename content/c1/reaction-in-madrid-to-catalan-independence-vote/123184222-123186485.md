    "description": "(2 Oct 2017) The actions of the Spanish police in dealing with Catalonia's disputed independence referendum made the front pages of news media outlets around the world on Monday.\r\nIn an editorial, leading Spanish daily El Pais blamed the Catalan government for Sunday's \"shameful\" events but also criticised the Spanish government for its inability to tackle the crisis since it began about seven years ago. The newspaper said the day was \"a defeat for our country.\"\r\nPeople in Madrid on Monday were split on the subject with some saying the central government had had no choice but to take action, while others called their actions disproportionate.\r\nCatalonia's government will hold a closed-door Cabinet meeting on Monday to discuss the next steps in its plan to declare independence from Spain following the disputed referendum.\r\nRegional officials say the vote, which Spain insists was illegal and invalid, shows that a majority favour secession.\r\nThe referendum debacle brought both Spain and Catalonia closer to a potentially disastrous showdown as each side said Sunday's events proved them right and neither looked prepared to cede ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9e2dc124cdb75d06cfdbb98851e6a9b8 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
