    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) Spain's Foreign Minister on Saturday accused \"anti-system groups\" supporting the referendum of \"adopting Nazi-like attitudes\", saying they encouraged the harassment of those who were against the public vote. \r\nSpeaking to the Associated Press, Alfonso Dastis Quecedo said \"if there is disturbance\" it come from \"the side of those who are advocating the referendum\".\r\nDastis added that the security forces were \"behaving very calmly\" ahead of the potentially explosive vote on whether the prosperous region should break away from the rest of Spain and become Europe's newest country.\r\nThe vote has been suspended by Spain's Constitutional Court and police have received orders to stop ballots from being cast on Sunday. \r\nThe regional government has pressed ahead and called on residents to vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/958bf65122cc6bffbd41d6383484510d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
