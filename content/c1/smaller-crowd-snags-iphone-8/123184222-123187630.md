    "description": "(22 Sep 2017) About a hundred Apple fans lined up outside the company's flagship store in San Francisco this morning to get their hands on the latest iPhone and Apple Watch.\r\nThat's not nearly as many as have lined up in past years, perhaps due to the new iPhone 8 being fairly similar to previous models.\r\nAlso, the much buzzed about iPhone X (ten), at a price point of one thousand dollars, won't come out for a few more months.\r\nBut those die hards who did line up for hours before today's store opening said it's part of the Apple fan experience, even if they can order many of the new products online.\r\nEarlier this week, Apple confirmed that the new Series 3 Apple Watch has problems connecting to a cellular network. \r\nThe problems arise when the Watch joins unauthenticated Wi-Fi networks \"without connectivity.\" The company says it is working to fix the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/e078e73f25785d1b8e3363fb05117a8c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
