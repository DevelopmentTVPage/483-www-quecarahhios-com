    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) Senate Republicans were responding in different ways Tuesday hours after Sen. Jeff Flake said his fellow Republicans have let President Donald Trump lead the country away from conservative principles and democratic ideals.\r\nFlake appeared on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Tuesday and discussed his new book \"Conscience of a Conservative\" in which he expands on his concerns for the country. \r\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to respond when asked about Flake's comments, saying \"I haven't had a chance to read Jeff Flake's book but I'm gonna do that.\"\r\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., defended his interactions with the president, saying \"I think I do a good job of pushing back when I think he is wrong.\"\r\nGraham also responded to a report that President Trump dictated the July 8 statement in which his son, Donald Trump Jr., described a June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer.\r\nThe statement said that Trump Jr. and other top members of the Trump campaign primarily discussed a Russian adoption program.\r\nEmails released later by Trump Jr. show the meeting was suggested to the campaign as a way to deliver damaging information about Democrat Hillary Clinton.\r\n\"If you want these investigations to come to an end, the last thing you need to do is reinforce the narrative that you're not being candid and honest about what happened,\" Graham said.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4ad14632235442b63bb84e191bf47d33 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
