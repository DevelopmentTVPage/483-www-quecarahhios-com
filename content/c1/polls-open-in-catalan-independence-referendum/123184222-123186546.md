    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) Polling has begun in a banned referendum on Catalonia's independence, with the first voters casting ballots amid cheers in some of the designated polling stations.\r\nParents, children and activist volunteers had occupied some of the 2,315 schools and other facilities to avoid closure from police acting on court orders.\r\nSpain's Constitutional Court ordered the vote to be suspended and central authorities say it's illegal. \r\nRegional separatist leaders have pledged to hold it anyway, promising to declare independence if the \"yes\" side wins, and have called on 5.3 million eligible voters to cast ballots.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a0caf92c8ee1f001c7c99829110285a1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
