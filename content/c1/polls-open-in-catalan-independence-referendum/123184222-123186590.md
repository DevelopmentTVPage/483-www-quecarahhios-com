    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) Voters geared up to cast ballots in a disputed referendum on Catalonia's split from Spain on Sunday.\r\nPolling station doors at Joan Miro school opened briefly to allow more officials in as voters massed outside.\r\nCatalan officials said that voters will be allowed to cast ballots at any polling station, rather than a designated one as previously announced, as many locations have been sealed off by police.\r\nA regional government spokesman said the last-minute system will allow the 5.3 million eligible voters to cast a ballot and avoid repeated votes.\r\nHe said that Catalans will be able to vote with ballots printed at home if needed, announcing that authorities had printed new ones after 5 million paper ballots were confiscated by police. He also said that a group of \"academics and professionals\" would serve as election observers.\r\nSpain's Constitutional Court ordered the vote to be suspended and central authorities say it's illegal. \r\nHopeful voters have been occupying out some of the designated voting stations to avoid police taking control and closing them off.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/7fe6bd38c15bfe31a311f1a3843f120c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
