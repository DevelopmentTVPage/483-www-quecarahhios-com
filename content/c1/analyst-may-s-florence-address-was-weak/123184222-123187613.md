    "description": "(22 Sep 2017) The head of the European Policy Centre says that British Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit speech on Friday was \"vague\" and is likely to disappoint EU leaders.\r\nSpeaking in Brussels on Friday, Fabian Zuleeg said there was \"very little new\" in May's speech in Florence, with EU leaders hoping for more \"signals of concessions\".\r\nMay urged EU leaders to approach the talks with creativity and ambition as she set out her ideas on breaking the deadlock in Brexit negotiations. \r\nThe talks have hit a roadblock on issues such as the amount that Britain must pay to settle its financial commitments to the bloc.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9abe0238382415ed752126260784c1a6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
