    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, says President Donald Trump's recent criticism of athletes isn't about the president being against something. \r\nInstead she says it's about Trump being \"for honouring the our flag and our country\".\r\nSanders was asked if the President went too far in his language when he described the NFL players that chose to kneel during the national anthem as SOB's.\r\nThe White House press secretary responded by saying that it is always appropriate for the President of the United States to defend patriotism.\r\nSanders also talked about the 60th anniversary of the integration of Little Rock Central High School and named the students involved that came to be known as the Little Rock Nine.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/65a6463d358da64e8184e13139831aff \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
