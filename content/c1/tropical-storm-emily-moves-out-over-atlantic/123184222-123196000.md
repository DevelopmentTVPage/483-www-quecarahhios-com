    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) Tropical Depression Emily is moving out over the Atlantic early Tuesday, a day after slogging across the Florida Peninsula, where it brought drenching rain and power outages.\r\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center says the depression's maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (48 kph). Forecasters say slight strengthening is possible during the day but the poorly-organized depression is expected to stop being a tropical system within a day or two.\r\nThe depression is centered about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north-northeast of Vero Beach, Florida, and is moving east-northeast near 12 mph (19 kph).\r\nMonday, the scattering, drenching rains, caused power outages and left two fishermen to be rescued from Tampa Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/be7e53d824dcc584ef4e74d548b4b285 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
