    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) KANYE WEST'S TOURING COMPANY SUES LLOYD'S OF LONDON\r\nA lawsuit filed Tuesday (01 AUGUST 2017) by representatives for Kanye West claims that insurers have failed to pay nearly $10 million for West's canceled Saint Pablo Tour last year.\r\nThe suit filed by Very Good Touring against several Lloyd's of London syndicates alleges breach of contract and seeks punitive damages and attorney fees beyond the $9.8 million in concert losses.\r\nWest canceled several scheduled concert appearances last year. He missed a few dates after his wife, Kim Kardashian West, was robbed in Paris. West canceled the remainder of his tour after he was admitted for undisclosed reasons to UCLA Neuropsychiatric Hospital on Nov. 21, 2016.\r\nAn after-hours message left for Lloyd's of London's New York office was not immediately returned.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/2c8c476e511183908157142f8b085f83 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
