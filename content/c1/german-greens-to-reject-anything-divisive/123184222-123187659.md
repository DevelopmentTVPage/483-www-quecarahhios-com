    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) Germany's Green party said on Monday that it would reject anything that divides the country or could be labelled as racist in the next parliament.\r\nDuring a news conference in Berlin, co-leaders Katrin Goering-Eckardt and Cem Ozdemir said they would not allow the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which took third place in Sunday's election, to \"dominate the agenda\".\r\nBut they said that the issues that led people to vote for the AfD, would have to be addressed.\r\nThey evaded questions about the possibility of a coalition with chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Free Democratic Party, FDP.\r\nMerkel said on Monday she could not say when a new German government will be in place, but that her country isn't \"the most urgent case\" in Europe.\r\nMerkel faces a complicated task to form a new government after Sunday's election. \r\nHer existing coalition partner has said it will go into opposition and she will now explore a three-way alliance with two new partners. \r\nThe haggling could take weeks or even months.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9bec7ba139efd007f0de3395e27c99f0 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
