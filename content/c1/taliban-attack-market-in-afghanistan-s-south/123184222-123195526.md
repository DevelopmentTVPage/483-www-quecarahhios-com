    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) The Taliban stormed a market on Friday in southern Helmand province.\r\nThe market, located in the Gareshk district, was closed because of the Muslim weekend and while no casualties were initially reported, one eyewwitness said a guard had been killed.\r\nAn Afghan army officer said five Taliban fighters were involved and four of them were killed in a gunbattle that ensued. \r\nThe district has been the scene of heavy fighting in recent weeks between Afghan security forces, backed by US air support, and the Taliban, who now control roughly 80 percent of Helmand province.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/24ad29822dcc47e38dd8b6bd1520ad1b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
