    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) LEAD IN\r\n\"Our cloth, our clothes\" is the theme of this year's Korean Clothes Exhibition.\r\nTraditional dress is also being marketed by designers for weddings and casual wear. \r\n\r\nSTORY-LINE:\r\nA fashion show in North Korea - and all the clothes are variations on the same traditional Korean style.\r\nThe 15th Exhibition of Korean Clothes opened at the Central Youth Hall in Pyongyang on Wednesday 27 September with a catwalk show featuring mostly \"chima choggori\" - that's what North Korea calls the traditional dress for women. \r\nIt's a wide dress with a tighter top fixed above the waist, and in North Korea the colours are usually brighter and bolder than in the south of Korea nowadays.\r\nA small audience of clothes trade workers watch the catwalk show.\r\nAround the hall, hundreds of mannequins display different designs, mostly of the women's outfits, with just a few designed for men or children.\r\nNorth Korean authorities like to promote traditional clothes as a part of national identity.\r\nBut it's normally women who are expected to wear the national costume on holidays and anniversaries, when they take part in organised dancing events or other big shows.\r\nTraditional Korean clothes for men are not worn so much in North Korea. \r\nFashion on the streets of Pyongyang is much more conventional, with women often now in high-waisted tight and narrow skirts and fitted shirts. \r\nMany men stick to traditional tunics and boxy suits. But some younger men look sharper with shirts, trousers, jackets all in a narrower profile.\r\nThe time when North Koreans really put effort into wearing traditional dress is at weddings. \r\nThere's now an industry of photo-taking before weddings, with young couples who can afford it visiting landmarks around the city dressed up in their finest before the big day. \r\nNormally the women will be in elaborate Korean dresses and the men in army uniform or European-style suits and ties.\r\nAt the Korean Clothes Exhibition this time, one exhibitor from Pyongyang gets a lot of attention - a clothes shop from Pyongyang's central district.\r\nIt's manager Jo Jong Sun says they put a lot of effort in trying to get lighter colour combinations with a traditional theme, and using intricate decorations. \r\nShe also wanted to emphasise that the material for the cloth was locally-made - that's a common emphasis in North Korea which is trying to rely on developing its economy in the face of sanctions.\r\nThe Korean Clothes Exhibition ran until Friday 29 September. It's been held every year since 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/e07834825a3bce92f234e6eb4af092a9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
