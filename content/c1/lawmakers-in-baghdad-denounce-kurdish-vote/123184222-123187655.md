    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) Lawmakers in Baghdad denounced the Kurdish independence referendum but say a full parliamentary session will convene on Wednesday to issue a clear resolution of action for the government.\r\nParliament met Monday without Kurdish lawmakers present. \r\nThe next full session is on Wednesday when lawmakers promised to push for punitive actions against the Kurdish region such as deploying military forces to contested areas, closing border crossings with Turkey and Iran and asking all foreign ambassadors to close their consulates in the Kurdish north.\r\nThe also want to maintain control of oil fields in disputed areas and prevent foreign oil companies from operating there as well as request that Turkey halts imports of oil from the Kurdish region.\r\nThe referendum on independence is non-binding, but it has strained tensions with Baghdad and regional powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cad868b3d66bbc2d33dbc3a59f696b49 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
