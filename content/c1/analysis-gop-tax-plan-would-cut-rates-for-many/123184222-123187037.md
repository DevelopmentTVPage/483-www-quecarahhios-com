    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are proposing a far-reaching, $5 trillion plan Wednesday that would cut taxes for corporations and potentially for individuals, simplify the tax system and nearly double the standard deduction used by most Americans.\r\nThe plan is sweeping in scope but omits critical, controversial details that are likely to take months to work out in a bitterly divided, GOP-led Congress. \r\nAs Associated Press writer Josh Boak explains, the plan would collapse the number of personal tax brackets from seven to three.\r\nThe individual tax rates would be 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent - and the plan recommends a surcharge for the very wealthy. But it doesn't set the income levels at which the rates would apply, so it's unclear just how much of a tax change there might be for a typical family, and whether its taxes would be reduced.\r\nThe plan would nearly double the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for families. This basically would increase the amount of personal income that is tax-free.\r\nDeductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving would remain, but the plan seeks to end most other itemized deductions that can reduce how much affluent families pay.\r\nBut there are no details on how much it would cost, though back-of-the-envelope estimates by outside experts put the tax cuts in the range of $5 trillion over the next 10 years. \r\n\"The problem is this could generate an additional trillions of dollars worth of debt over a decade and that could slow the growth that the president is promising,\" Boak says, adding, \"Someone will have to pay for it, because weather it's dessert or a full meal, there's no such thing as a free lunch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/b160d534350decf61975d5f3e14b1b90 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
