He says Cosby is taking steps to secure new lawyers.\r\nMontgomery County Judge Steven O'Neill will consider the request at a hearing Aug. 22.\r\nCosby is being retried on charges he drugged and molested Andrea Constand more than a decade ago.\r\nProsecutors found themselves back at square one June 17 after a judge declared a mistrial. The jury failed to reach a verdict in more than 52 hours of deliberations.\r\nThe 80-year-old comedian has said his encounter with the former Temple University worker was consensual.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8ec0a1c83753dabcb78f9d98dfeed082 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
