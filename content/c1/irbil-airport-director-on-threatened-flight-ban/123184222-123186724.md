    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Hundreds of passengers are filing through Irbil international airport in the hours ahead of a flight ban threatened by Baghdad following a controversial Kurdish independence referendum held this week.\r\nAll international flights travelling to and from the Kurdish region are expected to halt at 6:00 p.m. local time (1500GMT) Friday.\r\nTalar Saleh, the general director of Irbil International Airport, says Kurdish authorities were unaware of how to comply with Baghdad's demand to hand the airport over to federal authorities in order to avert the threatened flight ban.\r\nSaleh said authorities in Baghdad did not respond to requests for clarification.\r\nMilitary, humanitarian and diplomatic flights will continue from the airport uninterrupted according to the information relayed from Baghdad, Saleh added.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/d7a2077a49692dfad09a4724ab6a4f35 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
