    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) The Israeli military on Tuesday raided the West Bank home of the Palestinian attacker who killed three Israelis at the entrance to a settlement outside Jerusalem. \r\nA relative of the attacker was seen being arrested.\r\nIsraeli officials said the attacker, identified as as Nimr Mahmoud Ahmed Jamal, was a 37-year-old Palestinian father of four, with a valid work permit in Israel and a troubled personal life who appeared to have acted alone.\r\nHe opened fire at the entrance to the settlement, killing three Israeli security men and critically wounding a fourth, Israeli police and medical services said.\r\nThe attacker's uncle spoke to the media, saying the family had had no confirmation his nephew was involved in the attack until the raid.\r\nIn the Israeli Arab village of Abu Ghosh near Jerusalem, the father of one of the dead, 25-year-old Yousef Othman, said he son was loved by all who knew him.\r\nThe attack comes at a tense period amid the Jewish high holidays and is likely to complicate the mediation efforts of US peace envoy Jason Greenblatt, who had just arrived in the region for meetings with Israeli and Palestinians leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/be6e5fd0a30b2a2595e105530a8acb09 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
