    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a mosque in the Afghan capital on Friday, killing five people and wounding 29 others, authorities said, in the latest attack to target the country's minority Shiites.\r\nMohammad Salim Rasuli, chief of Kabul hospitals, confirmed the fatalities from the attack, which came as worshippers were leaving the Hussainia Mosque in central Kabul following Friday prayers. \r\nPolice officer Abdul Rahman said the attacker blew himself up on the street about 1,000 metres (1,094 yards) from the mosque.\r\nPolice official Sadiq Muradi said police confronted the attacker as he came through a checkpoint near the holy site, calling for him to stop. \r\nBut that's when he ignited his explosives, blowing himself up.\r\nMir Hussain Nasiri, a member of Kabul's Shiite clerics council, told The Associated Press the attacker was disguised as a sheepherder.\r\nMohammad Ismail, police chief of Kabul's 10th district, said a second person suspected of involvement was in custody.\r\nNo one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which took place two days before the Muslim holy day of Ashura. \r\nBut Afghanistan has faced a series of large-scale attacks in recent months targeting minority Shiites for which the Sunni-dominated Islamic State group affiliate in Afghanistan has taken responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3714d778307919c2c0bc8b5844cec6e4 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
