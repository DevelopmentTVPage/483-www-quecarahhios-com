    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are proposing a far-reaching, $5 trillion plan Wednesday that would cut taxes for corporations and potentially for individuals, simplify the tax system and nearly double the standard deduction used by most Americans.\r\nThe plan is sweeping in scope but omits critical, controversial details that are likely to take months to work out in a bitterly divided, GOP-led Congress. \r\nThe political stakes are high for Republicans and for Trump, whose agenda has largely stalled as the GOP abandoned efforts to repeal the Obama-era health law. \r\nRepublicans see tax overhaul as a once-in-a-generation opportunity that could produce a large political payoff, though some polls show the public is skeptical that average Americans will benefit much.\r\n\"This is a now or never moment,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan. \"The choice before us is really clear.\"\r\nThere are no details on how much it would cost, though back-of-the-envelope estimates by outside experts put the tax cuts in the range of $5 trillion over the next 10 years. \r\nThe net cost to the federal debt would be far less - probably in the range of $1.5 trillion under deal put together by Senate Budget Committee Republicans - and the real battles will come as lawmakers quarrel over which tax breaks might be eliminated to help pay the balance.\r\n\"We're closer than ever to finishing what we started for the American people, for the middle class workers and families, and the main street job creators, merely struggling to get by today,\" said Rep. Kevin Brady, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. \r\nThe plan would collapse the number of personal tax brackets from seven to three.\r\nThe individual tax rates would be 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent - and the plan recommends a surcharge for the very wealthy. But it doesn't set the income levels at which the rates would apply, so it's unclear just how much of a tax change there might be for a typical family, and whether its taxes would be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/b57122fc22b0e1905c5909831b179272 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
