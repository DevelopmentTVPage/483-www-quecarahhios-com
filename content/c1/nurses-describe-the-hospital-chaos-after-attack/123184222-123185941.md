    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) Nurses from the University Medical Center in Las Vegas described the \"chaos\" inside the trauma unit where over 100 patients were treated following the mass shooting in Las Vegas.  \r\nTrauma nurse Toni Mullan said \"there are no words to describe\" the scene she walked into on Sunday night.\r\nShe said there were almost double the number of gurneys than what the hospital has space for and the injured packed the hallways.\r\nAnother trauma nurse, Julie Anderson, said she just ran on adrenaline.\r\n\"You see family members that don't have any hope, you see 16 year olds without parents. You try not to think about that at the time, your job is to stabilize and get them what they need and then move onto the next,\" she said.\r\nOfficials say a total of 60 people remain hospitalized at University Medical out of the 104 who were taken there. 12 people were still in critical condition Tuesday. Four have died.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4352584b53bcb64772ac5a6aac52e5f1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
