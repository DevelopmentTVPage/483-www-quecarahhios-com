    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Spain's government cabinet spokesman says there will not be a referendum on Catalonia's independence on Sunday as announced by the regional Catalan government.\r\nCulture Minister Inigo Mendez de Vigo accuses the secessionist coalition ruling the northeastern region of bending the laws to go ahead with a vote regardless of warnings from courts and a suspension by the country's Constitutional Court earlier this month.\r\nCatalan authorities say they will declare independence within 48 hours after announcing the vote's results if the yes wins. The Spanish government has fought the referendum with a myriad of legal actions that have been criticized by many in Catalonia.\r\nMeanwhile European Union officials have ruled out helping to mediate the clash between Spain's government and Catalan officials over Catalonia's upcoming independence referendum.\r\nCatalan officials, including the mayor of Barcelona, have asked the EU to mediate the tense standoff ahead of Sunday's planned vote that Spanish authorities say is illegal.\r\nBut EU Parliament President Tajani says the EU is maintaining its support of Spain's government because \"on a legal level, Madrid is right.\"\r\nThe EU has said Catalonia will be ejected from the bloc, if it declares independence.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8196b34e122a431f85f9911e0c892202 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
