    "description": "(22 Sep 2017) US rescue workers helped Mexican rescuers dig through the rubble of a collapsed building south of Mexico City on Thursday, as they hunted for survivors following Tuesday's 7.1 magnitude earthquake.\r\nSeveral families lived in the building on Tlalpan Avenue.\r\nVolunteers in the neighbourhood asked drivers and passers-by to keep silent so that rescuers could listen out for cries for help. \r\nAt least 273 people are known to have died.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/23827dedaa1c9640dd205dc997daf9dc \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
