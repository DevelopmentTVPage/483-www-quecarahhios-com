    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) The Israeli police said the West Bank would be under closure until the end of the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur due to security concerns.\r\nWest Bank closures have been imposed during most Jewish holidays in recent years due to concerns that Palestinian militants could take advantage of the festival to carry out attacks in Israel.\r\nYom Kippur beings on Friday night and runs through Saturday.\r\nOn Tuesday, a Palestinian killed three Israelis and critically wounded a fourth outside the West Bank settlement of Har Adar before he was shot dead.\r\nYom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, is the holiest day on the Jewish calendar and Jews across the world traditionally spend the day fasting and praying.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/e23204143889a26851aee56efe1ea3b3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
