    "description": "(24 Sep 2017) Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) top candidate Martin Schulz cast his ballot in the country's national election on Sunday. \r\nSchulz voted in Wuerselen, the city where her served as mayor for more than a decade.\r\nHe is Chancellor Angela Merkel's main challenger.\r\nGerman voters will elect their new parliament on Sunday, but don't expect a new government to be in place next week.\r\nWith the seats expected to be spread across up to six caucuses, there's very little chance of anyone winning a majority to govern alone.\r\nAfter voters have had their say, it's down to Germany's political parties to put together a coalition to govern for the next four years.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a90d0d05e479b3f5fbbcb0e2d1fb753f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
