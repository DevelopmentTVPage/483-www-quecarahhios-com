    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) In the state of Saxony in the east of Germany, many said on Monday they were not surprised to see the nationalist Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, taking third place in Sunday's German election.\r\nThe party's election success follows a campaign that centred on harsh criticism of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her decision to let in large numbers of migrants. \r\nOne of its new members of parliament, police officer Karsten Hilse, said that having always voted CDU in the past, he saw no alternative to the AfD after what he described as the CDU's move to the left under Merkel. \r\nSpeaking at the AfD office in the town of Hoyerswerda, he suggested Merkel was responsible for creating the space for the AfD to \"exist today\" in the first place, adding that people did not want the presence of others who were \"not part of our culture\". \r\nHilse said he wants to use his new influence in Berlin to work for a more positive relationship with Russia, restrict immigration, re-establish border controls and push for new legislation that allows for more public referenda.\r\nAbout 40 kilometres (25 miles) away in Bautzen, a small medieval town of 40,000, mayor Alexander Ahrens is keen to stress that \"people who vote for the AfD are not bad people.\"\r\nAhrens said he was less surprised by the election results than by some of the reactions to them, which he said depicted AfD voters as \"stupid\", adding that was \"definitely not the case.\"\r\nAbout one million former CDU supporters voted for the AfD in Sunday's election, according to officials. \r\nSome of them explicitly attribute their motivation for voting AfD to the policies of Merkel, who after a lacklustre victory on Monday vowed to \"win (them) back\" with \"good politics and problem solving\".\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ca8e85649a946bff9c47c1cab9580641 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
