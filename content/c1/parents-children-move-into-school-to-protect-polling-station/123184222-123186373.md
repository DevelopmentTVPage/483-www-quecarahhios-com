    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) Parents and children have been camping out at a school in Barcelona to protect it from possible closure by police ahead of Sunday's referendum. \r\nA parent said that police had stopped by, but \"just to check\" and that they were \"positive and optimistic\". \r\nThe Escola Univers, a school in the Gracia neighbourhood, is set to be used as a polling station in a potentially explosive vote on whether the prosperous region should break away from the rest of Spain and become Europe's newest country.\r\nOn Friday, the Catalan police were ordered to clear out all 2,315 polling stations, most of them in schools, by 6 a.m. (0400 GMT) on Sunday to prevent the referendum from taking place.\r\nSeparatist groups had been calling on parents to organise activities with students at the schools to prevent police from closing them before the vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/64af2ed22526ee7a7cfc8246accca974 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
