    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY HAS A BOOK DEAL\r\nFlatiron Books told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Comey is writing a book about leadership and decision making that will draw upon his career in government. Comey will write about experiences that made him the FBI's best-known and most controversial FBI head in recent times, from his handling of the bureau's probe into Hillary Clinton's private email server to allegations of ties between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign. \r\nTrump fired Comey in May and soon after told NBC News that he was angered by the FBI's investigation into ``this Russia thing with Trump and Russia,'' which he called a fake story. Comey has since testified before Congress that Trump asked him to end an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn and kept memos about his meetings with the president.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cc19d25d405d2bd2ba763481001397d4 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
