    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) A British judge has refused to extradite a London-based Russian businessman who is accused of organising the murder of a retail tycoon in his homeland.\r\nRussian officials say Georgy Shuppe arranged the murder of Alexander Mineev, who was shot 22 times with a Kalashnikov rifle in January 2014 on the outskirts of Moscow. \r\nHe is also accused of having fraudulently taken over assets belonging to Mineev.\r\nShuppe's lawyers say the case against him is politically motivated.\r\nSpeaking to The Associated Press outside Westminster Magistrates' Court, Shuppe said he was \"pleased and delighted\" at the court's decision, adding that he was \"very tired\" and just wanted to go home.\r\nShuppe was formerly married to the daughter of oligarch Boris Berezovsky, a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. \r\nBerezovsky was found dead in his English mansion in 2013.\r\nDistrict Judge Kenneth Grant told Shuppe on Friday that \"I have rejected the Russian Federation's request for your extradition.\"\r\nRussia has 14 days to appeal against the decision.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/d394fbc2b24de59986a30df46ffcd4b7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
