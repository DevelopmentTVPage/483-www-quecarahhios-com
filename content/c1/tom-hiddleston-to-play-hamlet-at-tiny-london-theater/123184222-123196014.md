    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) TOM HIDDLESTON TO PLAY 'HAMLET' AT TINY LONDON THEATER\r\n\"Thor\" star Tom Hiddleston is to play Hamlet on the London stage - but fans will need a bit of luck to get a ticket.\r\nHiddleston is set to play the moody Danish prince for three weeks in September at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art's 180-seat theater.\r\nThe production, directed by Kenneth Branagh, is a fundraiser for the theater school, one of Britain's best. Branagh and Hiddleston are both graduates of RADA.\r\nHiddleston said Tuesday (1 AUG. 2017) that he hoped money raised would help the school train theater artists from every background, and \"keep the doors open for everyone.\"\r\nThe production runs Sept. 1-23. Tickets will be sold to people chosen at random after entering a ballot, open from Tuesday until 6 p.m. (1700GMT) Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/fa70da4c7559ce209f825e80981ecd16 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
