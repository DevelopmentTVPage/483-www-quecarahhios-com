    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) As a heatwave continues to sweep through the Balkans, on Friday people were turning to air conditioning companies for salvation. \r\nOnce considered a luxury item, air-conditioning is now a necessity in each household. \r\nTemperatures in Bosnia have been on a steady rise each year, as usually mild summers turn tropical, bringing daily temperatures to over 40 Celsius.\r\nIceNet, one of the largest Bosnian air conditioning firms is reporting a 50 percent rise in orders in just a few days since the heatwave struck the country.\r\nCalls from desperate residents in Sarajevo looking for a quick installation of air con have practically blocked IceNet's telephone lines.\r\nHundreds of air conditioning devices are installed daily in Sarajevo, mostly in residential areas with high rise apartment blocks, where the heat is particularly extreme.\r\nMeanwhile, Sarajevo swimming pools are overcrowded and officials are warning of the possibility of diseases spreading in such overcrowded facilities in this kind of heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1846de3e60502749dfc2e3e03d18e685 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
