    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) The Bank of England governor on Thursday said a transition period after the United Kingdom officially leaves the European Union in March 2019 would be desirable across all business sectors. \r\nMark Carney said a transition would address issues that \"will affect both sides of what is quite an integrated economy between the United Kingdom and the EU-27.\"\r\nOfficials have said that Britain will leave the bloc's single market and customs union, and end free movement from EU countries.\r\nBut officials also have said that the changes, which have huge economic implications, won't happen overnight.\r\nCarney added that uncertainty around the outcomes of negotiations between the UK and the bloc meant that many firms are reluctant to negotiate pay rises.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/0bfdec9d81cd8d958e444e9024b9cb30 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
