    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Thursday he expects players to stand for the national anthem, which is a league rule.\r\nHe wants them to remain active in their communities and take part in what can be difficult discussions, but he says they understand it's important to show respect for the flag.\r\nThe taking of a knee during the national anthem was started last year by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to draw attention to social inequality and police treatment of blacks. \r\nNo team signed Kaepernick last offseason, which many believe is because of the stand he has taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/52089120e10ef6c6f7cffa31db70f609 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
