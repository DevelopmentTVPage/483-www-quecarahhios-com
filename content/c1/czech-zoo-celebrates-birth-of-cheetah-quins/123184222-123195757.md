    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Prague Zoo said on Thursday five cheetah cubs recently born at the park are doing well.\r\nThe quintuplets - three males and two female - have survived the most critical period after their birth on 15 May.\r\nTheir mother, six-year-old Savannah, is taking good care of them, according to zoo officials.\r\nIt was the second litter for Savannah as she gave birth to quadruplets in 2014. \r\nIn both cases, five-year-old Ben was the father. \r\nThe cubs have not been named yet. \r\nVisitors will have the first chance to see them on 26 August.\r\nCheetahs are the fastest animals on land but also are vulnerable to various diseases. \r\nScientists say every cub is critical to saving the species, which is threatened with extinction in the wild.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c89b39c31640af116d5ee779587833b1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
