    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) The Food Bank For New York is shipping 26 pallets of food and supplies to Puerto Rico to help in recovery after Hurricane Maria devastated the island last week.\r\n\"Today's truck held about 20,000 meals,\" Margarette Purvis, CEO of the Food Bank For New York City, consisting of peanut butter, cereal and diapers.\r\nPurvis urged people wishing to donate not to send clothes.\r\n\"We need meals that are ready to eat,\" Purvis said, \"that do not require heating like tuna, peanut butter just things that you can eat right away.\" \r\nThe supplies are being sent directly to Puerto Rico for distribution by Banco de Alimentos de Puerto Rico, a sister organization on the island, to be distributed to victims of Hurricane Maria.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/420a8d22595c2b2f6d727fa20748a2a6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
