She drew a sharp rebuke from the city's mayor for saying Thursday that the federal relief effort is \"a good news story.\"\r\n Maria devastated the U.S territory of 3.4 million last week, destroying homes and businesses. It is blamed for 16 deaths on the island.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cabf51224bf9b8d28021c7e7a3933ce1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
