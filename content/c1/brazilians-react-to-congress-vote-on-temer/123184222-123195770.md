    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Brazilians reacted with mixed feelings a day after congress voted to not proceed with corruption charges against President Michel Temer.\r\nTemer survived a key congressional vote that could have suspended him over a bribery charge, mustering enough support Wednesday night to stay in office and avoid being tried by the country's highest court.\r\nPresident Michel Temer needed the support of just one-third of the 513 members of the lower Chamber of Deputies. \r\nIn the end 263 deputies voted for the president and 227 voted against him. The remaining were abstentions and absences.\r\nThe bribery allegation, which stunned even Brazilians inured to graft cases, was the latest in a bevy of scandals that has rocked the administration and created deep uncertainty and angst in Latin America's largest nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/792f5b3f7054a64c8be6e78fb014e89b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
