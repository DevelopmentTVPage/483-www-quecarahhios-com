    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) Israel's Prime Minister on Sunday denied any Israeli involvement in the independence referendum approved by Iraq's Kurds.\r\nIn mid-September, the Israeli leader said his country supported Kurdish independence ahead of a key referendum on the matter. \r\nIn an announcement , Netanyahu's office said Israel considered the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, a terrorist organization.\r\nBut the statement said Israel \"supports the legitimate efforts of the Kurdish people to attain a state of its own.\"\r\n\"I understand why those who support Hamas are in the habit of seeing the Mossad in every place that's inconvenient for them, but Israel had no part in the Kurdish referendum, aside from the deep, natural sympathy over many years for the Kurdish people and their aspiration,\"  Netanyahu said during the weekly cabinet meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6ed2ad0d5a68c0a89649c95e5d717c4d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
