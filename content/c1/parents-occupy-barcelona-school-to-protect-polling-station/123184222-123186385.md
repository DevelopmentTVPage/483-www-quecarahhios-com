    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) Parents and children have been camping out at a school in the Gracia neighbourhood of Barcelona to protect it from possible closure by police ahead of Sunday's referendum. \r\nThe school is set to be used as a polling station in a potentially explosive vote on whether the prosperous region should break away from the rest of Spain and become Europe's newest country.\r\nOn Friday, the Catalan police were ordered to clear out all 2,315 polling stations, most of them in schools, by 6 a.m. (0400 GMT) on Sunday to prevent the referendum from taking place.\r\nSeparatist groups had been calling on parents to organise activities with students at the schools to prevent police from closing them before the vote.\r\nWith weeks of antagonism and tension coming to a head, neither side was showing signs of backing down from a confrontation that has pitched Spain into a political and constitutional crisis.\r\nThe Madrid-based Spanish government has maintained the ballot cannot and will not happen because it contravenes the constitution, which refers to \"the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation.\" \r\nAny vote on Catalan secession would have to be held across all of Spain, the government says.\r\nThe Catalan regional government and local civic groups insist they are entitled to exercise their democratic rights and intend to do so regardless of the obstacles.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a76cbdcc62230aac1e3a1d282bdc7c64 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
