    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Police on Friday detained Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny ahead of a rally in a major city.\r\nNavalny had planned to travel to the city of Nizhny Novgorod where he was to lead a rally later on Friday.\r\nNavalny tweeted from the police station, saying he had not been told why he had been detained.\r\nThe Tass news agency on Friday quoted police as saying that Navalny was detained because of his calls for unsanctioned rallies.\r\nThe rally in Nizhny Novgorod, however, had received City Hall approval.\r\nHis press secretary Kira Yarmish said she thought the detainment was linked with Navalny's intention to hold an unsanctioned rally in St.Petersburg.\r\nThe Kremlin has dismissed Navalny, who has faced repeated jailings and criminal cases, as an urbanite out of touch with people living in Russia's 11 time zones from where President Vladimir Putin draws his support.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/7797fbcfc68dc0fc615b372fa955d203 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
