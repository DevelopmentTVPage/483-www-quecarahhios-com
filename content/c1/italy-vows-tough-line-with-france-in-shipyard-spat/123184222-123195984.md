    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) The French minister of economy met with his Italian counterpart in Rome on Tuesday to discuss a deal after a temporary decision by France to nationalise a French shipyard. \r\nThe move by the French government thwarted Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri's bid for a majority stake in STX.\r\nSpeaking to reporters Bruno Le Maire said his government's decision was \"a temporary one\" and the ultimate goal was to to build with Italy \"a big European industrial champion in the naval, civil and military field\".\r\nThe Italian minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, said Italy was not prepared to accept \"a 50-50 distribution\" of control over the shipyard, a deal favoured by France.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/934aafe19e8ba2685bc33e254225a66c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
