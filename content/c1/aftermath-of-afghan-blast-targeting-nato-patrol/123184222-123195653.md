    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) A Taliban suicide bomber struck a NATO patrol in Afghanistan, killing a service member and two civilians, Afghan officials said on Friday. \r\nThe attack the previous evening hit the patrol near Qarabagh, barely 30 kilometres (18 miles) north of Kabul.\r\nThe attacker had concealed his explosives beneath the all-enveloping women's garment known as a burqa, according to a district official.\r\nIt was the second suicide bombing in as many days that targeted NATO. \r\nA Taliban spokesman claimed 11 Americans were killed in Thursday's bombing, but the US military said one person died and six were wounded, including an Afghan translator.\r\nThe conflicting death tolls could not be immediately explained, but the Taliban routinely exaggerate their claims.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6342a8a90de2dd45107619c09ec43ff4 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
