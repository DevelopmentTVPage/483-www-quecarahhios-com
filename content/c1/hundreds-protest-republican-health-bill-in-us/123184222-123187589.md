    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) Hundreds of disability rights activists and others opposed to the Republican Graham Cassidy health care bill stood in line outside the Senate Finance Committee room Monday to show their opposition as a hearing into the measure got underway.\r\nThe bill would repeal the financing for Obama's health insurance expansion and create a big pot of money states could tap to set up their own programmes, with less federal oversight. \r\nIt would also loosen through state waivers current insurance rules that protect people with pre-existing conditions and limit spending for Medicaid, the federal-state programme that now covers more than 70 million low-income people.  \r\nThe nation's doctors, hospitals and health insurance plans have all come out in opposition to the Republican bill.\r\nIn a joint statement on Saturday, major groups such as the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, America's Health Insurance Plans and the BlueCross BlueShield Association called on the Senate to reject the measure, warning that patients and consumers will lose important protections and those with significant illnesses will be charged higher premiums and may not be able to buy coverage.\r\nThey also say the cuts to Medicaid would cause millions of Americans to lose their coverage - and the changes would weaken individual insurance markets, making coverage more costly.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cd92a2584acf5f5f6c372ed1590518b6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
