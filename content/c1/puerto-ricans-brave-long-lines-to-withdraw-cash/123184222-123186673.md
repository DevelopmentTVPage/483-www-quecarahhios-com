    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Many Puerto Ricans in San Juan took a deep breath and began the necessary process of waiting in long queues in the hopes of getting some cash from their banks.\r\nWith the electrical grid wrecked across the island, ATM machines are unusable and monetary transactions are all having to be done with cash. All bank transactions are being done by hand which makes the process of withdrawing money a lengthy one.\r\nPeople in the queues expressed the need for calm given the circumstances. \r\nHurricane Maria devastated the US territory of 3.4 (m) million last week, destroying homes and businesses. It is blamed for 16 deaths on the island.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9a8702675c5a0162ac853e1b5d3a42d0 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
