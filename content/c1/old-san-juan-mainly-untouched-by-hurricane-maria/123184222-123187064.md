    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) Old San Juan, a jewel of historic colonial architectcture in Puerto Rico was largely unscathed when Category 4, Hurricane Maria passed over the island less than a week ago.\r\nOn Wednesday, some of the family owned businesses in the historic district of the capital were open for business, managing as best they could without electricity. \r\nOne restaurant 'Mallorca' moved its tables outside onto the pavement with the cook cooking by the light of a kerosene lamp. \r\nAround the corner the employees of a pharmacy were counting item prices using pen and paper, as their cash registers weren't functioning. \r\nMore than half the residents of Puerto Rico remain without water, and most without power nearly a week after Hurricane Maria hit.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cc67a223e1e0076fae6d435666297811 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
