    "description": "(2 Oct 2017) STORYLINE:\r\nBangladesh's foreign minister said on Monday that Myanmar \"has made proposals for taking back the Rohingya refugees\".\r\nAH Mahmood Ali made the remarks after holding discussions with a Myanmar delegation led by U Kyaw Tint Swe, a minister of Myanmar's State Counsellor Office.\r\nMore than half a million Rohingya refugees have fled from the region to Bangladesh in just over a month, the largest refugee crisis to hit Asia in decades. \r\nThe current exodus is in addition to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who fled prior violence in Myanmar, where Rohingya have faced decades of persecution and discrimination in the Buddhist-majority nation.\r\nAli told reporters that both the counties had agreed to form a joint working group to start work on the repatriation.\r\nThe Myanmar delegation did not speak to the media.\r\nThe latest violence began when a Rohingya insurgent group launched deadly attacks on security posts on 25 August, prompting Myanmar's military to launch \"clearance operations\" to root out the rebels. \r\nThose fleeing have described indiscriminate attacks by security forces and Buddhist mobs. \r\nThe government has blamed the Rohingya, saying they set fire to their own homes, but the UN and others accuse it of ethnic cleansing.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4dc0f4def011e4d1c53ff2d77f1cc674 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
