    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) The departure hall at Irbil International Airport was largely deserted on Saturday morning after the Iraqi central government imposed a ban on international flights servicing airports in Iraq's Kurdish region.\r\nThe ban came into effect Friday evening at 6:00 p.m. local time (1500GMT).\r\nOnly domestic flights departed from the Irbil International Airport on Saturday. \r\nThe decision to shut down the flights comes amid tensions over an overwhelming \"yes\" vote in an independence referendum held this week in Iraq's Kurdish region and disputed territories.\r\nIraq's Transport Ministry ordered international airlines to halt service to Irbil, the Kurdish regional capital, and Sulaimaniyah, its second city.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5ac48b24fa581c010113baa389da2dae \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
