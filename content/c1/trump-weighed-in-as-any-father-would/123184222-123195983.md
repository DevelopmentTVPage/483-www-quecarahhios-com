    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Tuesday that President Donald stood by his son on the accuracy of his son's statement regarding a June 2016 meeting his son Donald Trump Jr. had with a Russian lawyer.\r\nMonday night, The Washington Post reported that Trump himself had dictated the July 8 statement in which his son Donald Jr. described a June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer.\r\nThe statement said Trump Jr. and other top figures in the Trump campaign \"primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children\" with the lawyer. \r\nEmails released later by Trump Jr. showed that the meeting was suggested to the Trump campaign as a means to deliver damaging material about Trump's election opponent, Hillary Clinton.\r\nLast week, Kushner met privately at the Capitol with members of the Senate and House intelligence committees.\r\nHe acknowledged four meetings with Russians during and after Trump's victorious White House bid and insisted that he had \"nothing to hide.\"\r\nHuckabee Sanders also said the White House was not involved in crafting a Fox News story that implicated a murdered Democratic National Committee staffer in the WikiLeaks scandal.\r\nA lawsuit filed by an investigator who worked on the Seth Rich case claims Fox News fabricated quotes and coordinated with the Trump administration on its later-redacted story.\r\nThe investigator, a Fox contributor, also alleged meeting with former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.\r\nSanders says she sees nothing wrong with Spicer meeting with members of the press.\r\nShe's referring questions to the parties involved in the suit.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3e98ea1fbe3e56d7a8b57bc380ba25c4 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
