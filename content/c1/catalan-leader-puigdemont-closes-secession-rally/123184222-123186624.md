    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Thousands of people attended a pro-independence rally on Friday in Barcelona, the capital of the Spanish region of Catalonia.\r\nThe region is on a collision course with the central Spanish government in Madrid as a contentious independence referendum was still slated for Sunday despite efforts by the courts and police to stop it.\r\nWith weeks of antagonism and tension coming to a head, neither side was showing signs of backing down from a confrontation that has pitched Spain into a political and constitutional crisis.\r\nCatalonia's ruling separatist coalition has promised to declare independence in 48 hours if the 'yes' camp wins on Sunday.\r\nSpain's Constitutional Court ordered the suspension of the referendum.\r\nWhile opinion polls have indicated the vast majority of Catalans favour holding a referendum, they are almost evenly split over independence itself.\r\nActing on court orders, police have confiscated about 10 million ballot papers and some 1.3 million posters advertising the referendum, and have blocked the distribution of ballot boxes.\r\nOn Friday, the Catalan police were ordered to clear out all 2,315 polling stations, most of them in schools, by 6 am (0400 GMT) on Sunday to prevent the referendum from taking place.\r\nThe Catalan regional government and local civic groups insist they are entitled to exercise their democratic rights and intend to do so regardless of the obstacles.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/73d607abf0a34f44ecf82bf482cd6939 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
