    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have arrived in storm-damaged Puerto Rico.\r\nThe first couple is visiting Tuesday to review the U.S. island's recovery from Hurricane Maria, which blew ashore Sept. 20. \r\nThey are meeting with local and federal officials working to restore power and deliver food and supplies to Puerto Rico's 3.4 million people.\r\nTrump's visit comes after what critics have said was a too-slow response to the crisis on the island. \r\nTrump said Tuesday that Puerto Rico has thrown the U.S. \"budget a little out of whack.\"  But he said it's worth it because a lot of lives have been saved.\r\nThe president compared the aftermath of Puerto Rico to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, where more than 1,800 people lost their lives and said rescue and recovery teams should be \"very proud.\"\r\nThe death toll to date in Puerto Rico following Maria is 16 people.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/0797b3f971bc5af3af97f0004315851d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
