    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) Pro-democracy groups protested in Hong Kong on Sunday against what they described as the authorities' \"authoritarian rule\" and to demand that the secretary of justice step down for eroding the rule of law after new stiffer sentences were imposed on student leaders.\r\nThousands of protesters set off from Victoria Park as the territory marked its National Day holiday. \r\nJustice Secretary Rimsky Yuen appealed a decision by a lower court to hand out only suspended prison terms and community service to three leaders of the 2014 pro-democracy protests over their roles in the so-called Occupy movement.\r\nThe court of appeal instead imposed between six and eight months of imprisonment on activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow. \r\nThe former British colony maintains civil liberties unseen on mainland China including freedom of speech following its 1997 handover, but many residents fear Beijing is tightening its grip.\r\nSome young activists have started promoting the once-unthinkable notion of independence from mainland China after massive pro-democracy protests ended without resolution in 2014. \r\nThere's almost no chance of success but their ideas have alarmed China's Communist leaders in Beijing.\r\nHong Kong's Beijing-backed government has clamped down on such sentiment, including using the courts to get two newly elected pro-independence lawmakers disqualified from office last year for making improper oaths of office.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ded615b165287cbdc57ef2b9e071f534 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
