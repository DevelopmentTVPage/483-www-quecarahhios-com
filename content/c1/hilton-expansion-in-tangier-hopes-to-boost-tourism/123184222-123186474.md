    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) LEAD IN\r\nAmerican hotel giant Hilton is expanding its presence in Tangier in a move which is being viewed as a positive sign for Moroccan tourism.\r\nIts five-star Hilton Tanger Center Hotel and Residences opened on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nSTORY-LINE\r\nA local band bangs drums and plays trumpets to mark the opening of the new five-star Hilton Tanger Center Hotel and Residences.\r\nHotel industry presidents have the honour of cutting the ribbon.\r\nWith its 180 rooms and suites, it's hoped this new hotel will boost tourism in Tangier, an industry that is already witnessing a revival at national level. \r\nHilton, which manages more than 5,000 hotels worldwide, re-established its presence in Morocco in 2016 with the opening of Hilton Inn Garden in Tangier,\r\nThe chain will also manage another hotel in Tangier from next summer after signing a contract with a Moroccan developer to run a mid-scale hotel in Casablanca and another one in Agadir. \r\nWith five units in total, Hilton hopes to not only help Morocco improve its tourism revenues, but also satisfy travellers seeking an international hotel brand.\r\n\"It's not a new return, it's just the opportunities are here and I think the confidence within the economy and the investor, which are mostly important, that actually everybody believes that the growth in Morocco certainly has a great future and therefore we will participate in all the successes in the future,\" says Rudi Jagersbacher, the president of Hilton Worldwide in the Middle East and Africa. \r\nJagersbacher's colleague Mohab Ghali, the Vice President for Operations in Egypt and North Africa, believes Moroccan tourism is growing thanks to the efforts deployed by both public and private sector.\r\n\"We are returning with five hotels which is not nothing,\" he says. \r\nAnd he says they won't just stop at five hotels but will continue to look for more opportunities in Morocco which he calls a \"promising market\".\r\nBut for tourism professionals such as Abdelghani Ragala, the General Director of the Regional Tourism Council for Tangier, Tetouan and Al Hoceima, building hotels and increasing the number of beds is not the best solution for the problems Moroccan tourism is facing.\r\nThe expert, who has been in the tourism industry for more than 40 years, believes tourists are attracted by a destination more than by hotel availability. \r\nMorocco's tourism industry remains resilient, even if its objective of reaching 20 millions tourists by 2020 has been now abandoned. \r\nThis year, Morocco is hoping to attract 11 million tourists who will generate around 70 billion Moroccan Dirhams (7 billion US Dollars), according to the Moroccan National Tourist Office. \r\nDuring the first six months of this year, 4.6 million tourists visited the country, an increase of nine per cent compared to the same period a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Tourism, Air Transport, Crafts and Social Economy. \r\nA significant growth in the number of Chinese visitors has been reported, which could be explained partly by Rabat's decision to drop visa requirements for Chinese tourists in July 2016 and also by the interest of Chinese investors in Morocco. \r\nThe increase is even more impressive given that no direct flights exist between the two countries. \r\nChinese tourist Wang Hu says Morrco is \"very different\" to his home country.\r\nAnother Chinese tourist, Li Lu, is impressed by the \"good history, good beauty, good food\".\r\nWith 42,000 Chinese tourists in 2016, a 300 per cent year-on-year increase from 2015, Morocco has announced a goal of 100,000 visitors from China in 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/840e7ffe0decb27aea5b96652b14036a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
