    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) Spanish police were holding back people who had come to vote in a banned referendum on Catalonia's independence outside a polling station in Institut Escola del Treball in Barcelona on Sunday. \r\nSpain's Constitutional Court ordered the vote to be suspended and central authorities say it's illegal. \r\nRegional separatist leaders have pledged to hold it anyway, promising to declare independence if the \"yes\" side wins, and have called on 5.3 million eligible voters to cast ballots.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/d9cb06e6eeafe31e4e12eb3a60b3fcc3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
