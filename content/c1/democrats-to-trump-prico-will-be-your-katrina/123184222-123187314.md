    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) House Democrats on Tuesday sought to shine a spotlight on the growing humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, and called on President Donald Trump to \"grasp the severity\" of the situation and send immediate federal and military aid to the island.\r\nNew York Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, a Puerto Rican native who traveled to the storm-ravaged island over the weekend, said the situation is so catastrophic, she \"didn't recognize\" what she saw.\r\nVel\u00e1zquez and fellow New York congressman Joe Crowley said they are concerned about the lack of response to date from the White House and urged the administration to send massive aid immediately.\r\nFive days after the Category 4 storm slammed into Puerto Rico, many of the more than 3.4 million U.S. citizens in the territory were still without adequate food, water and fuel.  \r\nMost of the island remains without power and officials say it may not be restored for more than a month.\r\nPresident Trump announced Tuesday morning he will travel to Puerto Rico next week.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a4d2b00f0f47b0f38ba0b5147effc895 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
