    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) Venezuela's Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected sanctions placed on President Nicolas Maduro by the United States, saying it's an attempt to submit the county to \"imperialist interests\".\r\nOn Monday, the US government imposed sanctions on Maduro over Sunday's disputed election of a pro-government assembly with almost unlimited political powers. \r\nMaikel Moreno, the high court's president, said the sanctions are a violation of international rights, and disrupts the \"sovereignty and the auto-determination of the people.\"\r\nThe U.S. added Maduro to a steadily growing list of high-ranking Venezuelan officials targeted by financial sanctions, after the Venezuelan leaders called elections for a constitutional assembly, a new legislative body trumping the current one, led by the opposition. \r\nThe sanctions involve freezing of assets for him his relative and close associates. \r\nThe Trump administration backed away from earlier threats to sanction Venezuela's oil industry \u2014 a move that could undermine Maduro's government but raise U.S. gas prices and deepen Venezuela's humanitarian crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/14bb335dc3e96e63f4d9aff599e6cf37 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
