    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) An Australian woman was sentenced on Thursday to one and a half years in jail for providing commercial surrogacy services in Cambodia.\r\nCambodia banned commercial surrogacy last year after becoming a popular destination for would-be parents seeking women to give birth to their children.\r\nTammy Davis-Charles, who was arrested in November, said in previous court appearances that she launched her business in Cambodia only after consulting three local lawyers who assured her the clinic was legal.\r\nThe surrogates were paid $10,000 for each pregnancy, she has said.\r\nDeveloping countries are popular for surrogacy because costs are much lower than in nations such as the United States and Australia, where surrogate services are around $150,000. \r\nThe surrogacy business boomed in Cambodia after it was put under tight restrictions in neighboring Thailand. \r\nThere also were crackdowns in India and Nepal.\r\nAfter Cambodia's crackdown, the trade has shifted to neighboring Laos.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/64a954ad573d907230456cda3346ccc9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
