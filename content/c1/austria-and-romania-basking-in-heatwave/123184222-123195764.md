    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) As temperatures across Europe soared on Thursday, people tried to beat the heat by going swimming. \r\nIn the Austrian capital, Vienna, the mercury climbed to 38 degrees Celsius. \r\nTo cool down, Austrians headed to inner city swimming pools, such as the \"Badeschiff\"' (bathing ship) at the banks of the River Danube.\r\nMeanwhile in Romania, meteorologists on Thursday issued a warning about unusually high temperatures, with 42 Celsius forecast for parts of western Romania. \r\nLocals in the capital, Bucharest, searched for relief from the scorching weather at a nearby lake, despite not being allowed to swim there. \r\nThe heat wave, which began Monday, is expected to last until the middle of next week.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5201b94c9dc56d450ebaa805ac281c0a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
