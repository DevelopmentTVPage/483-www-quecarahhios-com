    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Brazilian lawmakers on Wednesday continued to debate on whether to suspend President Michel Temer and investigate him for bribery charges.\r\nTemer would be suspended and put on trial before the country's top court if two thirds of the 513 members vote against him.\r\nTemer is deeply unpopular among Brazilians. The latest poll last week put his approval rating at 5 percent. Despite that, the government believes it has enough votes for Temer to survive.\r\nBrazil's attorney general charged Temer in June for allegedly orchestrating a scheme to line his pockets with millions in bribes. Temer denies that.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/7d1ade3b0c1ec9364e1fd1d1de817ad9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
