    "description": "(31 Jul 2017) Dozens of firefighters assisted by five water-dropping helicopters are battling a large brush fire south of Athens, but Greek authorities say no inhabited areas are in immediate danger.\r\nThe fire service said 70 firefighters on the ground, backed up by more than 30 fire engines and water tankers, are taking part in the operation.\r\nThe blaze broke out Monday in the Kalyvia area some 30 kilometres (18 miles) south of Athens, and quickly spread through tinder-dry vegetation due to strong winds.\r\nGiorgos Sofronis, mayor of the local Saronikos area, said it was a big blaze but no homes were threatened.\r\nAuthorities were trying to contain the fire before nightfall, after which water-dropping aircraft cannot operate.\r\nSummer wildfires are common in Greece. Dozens of people died in major blazes in 2007.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/bab30c1a07302610704e5f94d06c25f6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
