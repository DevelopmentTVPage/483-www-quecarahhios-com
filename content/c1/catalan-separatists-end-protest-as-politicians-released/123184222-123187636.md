    "description": "(22 Sep 2017) A large and noisy demonstration lasting more than 24 hours in Barcelona against the raids and arrests dispersed on Friday afternoon after six people arrested in the crackdown on preparations for an independence referendum were released.\r\nThe President of Catalan National Assembly (ANC) Jordi Sanchez said the rally had been \"very positive\" and vowed to continue to work for the 1 October referendum to go ahead. \r\nA Catalan regional judge on Friday ordered the release with restrictions of six officials arrested on Wednesday. \r\nMeanwhile some 2,000 students were still staging a separate pro-referendum demonstration at one of Barcelona's main universities. \r\nCatalonia represents a fifth of Spain's 1.1-trillion-euro (1.32 trillion US dollar) economy and enjoys wide self-government. \r\nThe region has about 5.5 million eligible voters. \r\nPolls consistently show the region's inhabitants favor holding a referendum but are roughly evenly divided over independence from Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a9778e2765b0fc2f9614477a05a578c2 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
