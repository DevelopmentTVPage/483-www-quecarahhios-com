    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) U.S. Vice President Mike Pence touched down Tuesday in new NATO member Montenegro, a country facing strong pressure from Russia, as part of his tour of Europe.\r\nPence strongly pledged America's commitment to protecting NATO allies against attacks, including the Baltic states, which have anxiously watched a growing Russian military presence in the region.\r\nMutual defense is a vital issue for the three small former Soviet states that border Russia, which were all occupied for nearly five decades by Soviet troops before regaining their independence in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/b60b584785166b3b37861034ad51a7ee \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
