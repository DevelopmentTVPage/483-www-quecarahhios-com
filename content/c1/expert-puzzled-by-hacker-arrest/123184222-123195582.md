    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) A computer law expert on Friday said the arrest by US authorities of the British hacker credited with derailing a global cyberattack earlier this year was \"problematic.\"\r\nTor Ekeland, Managing Partner at Tor Ekeland Law P.C., told the Associated Press that Marcus Hutchins' indictment was very weak and created a climate of distrust towards the US government among the software experts community.\r\nHutchins was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly creating and distributing malicious software designed to collect bank account passwords.\r\nHe was detained in Las Vegas on his way back to Britain from an annual gathering of hackers and information security gurus.\r\nEkeland told British media earlier on Friday that the charges against Hutchins carry a statutory maximum of up to 40 years in jail.\r\nNews of his detention came as a shock to the cybersecurity community.\r\nMany had rallied behind the researcher whose quick thinking helped control the spread of the WannaCry ransomware attack that crippled thousands of computers.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4f902296d53a91c4b4bb300f42d3d612 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
