    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) Around a hundred activists staged an anti-Israel protest near the Israeli Embassy in Amman on Friday.\r\nProtesters chanted anti-Israel slogans and called on the Jordanian government to annul a 1994 peace treaty with Israel and to shut down the Israeli Embassy.\r\nRiot police prevented protesters from marching toward the embassy.\r\nThe protest comes amid heightened diplomatic tensions between Israel and Jordan over the escalation around a contested Jerusalem shrine and over last month's deadly shooting at the Israeli Embassy in Amman.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3f646a439faf594efee7801cefaae08f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
