    "description": "(28 Sep 2017) Saudi Arabia's surprise decision to grant women the right to drive rattled society in the kingdom on Wednesday, bringing cheers from rights activists and young people and grumbling from others who say they will never let their wives and daughters behind the wheel.\r\nSaudi activist Hala Al-Dosari was one to celebrate but she says the decree comes at a questionable time when the Saudi government is under fire for regional turbulence and its tough hand on activists in the country. \r\nSome positives of the decree, aside from increased autonomy: Household incomes should fare positively, as women will no longer have to spend extra income to hire drivers. \r\nStress, according to Al-Dosari, is also likely to improve. \r\nShe says women in Saudi Arabia spend an incredible amount of time trying to plan their days and their rides to and from. \r\nBut for those still under a guardian's watch, she said, things will likely stay the same.\r\nAl-Dosari added that reforms should look to improve the lives of all, not just that of few. \r\nThe lifting of the ban is the most dramatic step yet in a campaign by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to modernise the kingdom. \r\nThe young royal has been promoting change to boost the country's economy and ease international criticism, all while risking backlash from clerics and others who adhere to the ultraconservative Wahhabi interpretation of Islam.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/db0ff74a94b30798f25dc171dc6defd0 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
