    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Over 2,000 people lined up in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Thursday to try and board the Royal Caribbean ship, the Adventure of the Seas.\r\nThe cruise ship was sent to San Juan to help evacuate people struggling to find a way off the hurricane battered island.\r\nDavin Safer and his wife Cara Rookwood live in Philadelphia and have been trying to make it back from the island of Vieques.  \r\n\"I've never imagined that there could be so little security in America,\" said Safer as they waited.\r\nTaylor McCloskey is from Puerto Rico, but attends school in Miami and was visiting family when hurricane Irma shut down her school in Florida for three weeks.  \r\nNow she can't get back.  \r\nPuerto Rico tourism officials say 1,000 tourists are still on the island and the Royal Caribbean ship will be taking approximately 800 of them.  \r\nThe rest of the passengers are from Puerto Rico or friends and family of Royal Caribbean employees.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/f3f115e08ca93c635b7f5785239fc778 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
