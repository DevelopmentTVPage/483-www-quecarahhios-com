    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) AP's Global Football Writer says Paris Saint-Germain will be turned into a \"new stratosphere\" after the French club bought Brazilian forward Neymar for a world record 222 million euro (262 million US dollar) price tag.\r\n25-year-old Neymar was presented to the media at the PSG stadium on Friday after his buyout clause from Barcelona was activated. \r\nNeymar has become the 31st Brazilian player in PSG's history when he finally signed a five-year contract until June 2022, putting the transfer saga to an end on Thursday.\r\nNeymar won a Champions League, two Spanish league trophies, three Copa del Reys, one Club World Cup, a UEFA Super Cup and two Spanish Super Cups in his four seasons at Barcelona.\r\nBarcelona says that it is \"very displeased\" with Neymar and will not pay its former player the 26 million euros (30.9 million US dollars) stipulated as a bonus in his last contract.\r\nThe bonus was due to Neymar from a contract renewal last year that was supposed to keep him at the Spanish club through to 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/d41ffc4b50fc9b26482501b89d86b49d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
