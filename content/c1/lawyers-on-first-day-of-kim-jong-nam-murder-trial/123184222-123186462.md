    "description": "(2 Oct 2017) Two women accused of fatally poisoning the estranged half brother of North Korea's ruler pleaded not guilty as their trial began on Monday in Malaysia's High Court, nearly eight months after the brazen airport assassination that sparked a diplomatic standoff.\r\nSiti Aisyah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam are suspected of smearing Kim Jong Nam's face with the banned VX nerve agent on February 13 at a crowded airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur, killing him within about 20 minutes.\r\nThe women say they thought they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden-camera show.\r\nLawyers for two women, who face the death penalty if convicted, asked the court to compel prosecutors to identify four people still at large mentioned in the charge sheet as having a common intention to kill Kim. The judge denied the request.\r\nThe prosecution phase of the trial is expected to last about two months, after which the judge will decide if there is a strong case for the women to have to mount their defense, said Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, Huong's lawyer.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/f925c963f0f048c16e2ebaf25c4e92f7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
