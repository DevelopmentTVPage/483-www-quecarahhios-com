    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) Venezuelan opposition members on Monday reacted to new United States sanctions imposed on Venezuelan officials. \r\nEconomist Angel Alvarez says he agrees with the ban but urged that it be focused solely on officials, not the Venezuelan people.\r\nOn Sunday, US President Donald Trump signed an order that will bar certain Venezuelan government officials and their immediate families from entering the US.\r\nEarlier Monday, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the UN General Assembly that Trump acted like \"the world's emperor.\" \r\nTrump had said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was running a \"corrupt regime.\"\r\nArreaza also said that it is a US strategy to discredit Venezuela to the public. \r\nHe also insisted that Venezuela has always been open to dialogue.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c3f7e980f583465f61ecc6cb570fb4dc \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
