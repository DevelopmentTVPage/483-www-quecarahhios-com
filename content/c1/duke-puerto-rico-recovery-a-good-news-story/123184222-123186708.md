    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) The mayor of San Juan says the suffering in hurricane-damaged Puerto Rico is \"not a good news story.\"\r\nActing Homeland Secretary Elaine Duke had suggested as much a day earlier in the White House driveway, saying the federal response to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria is \"a good news story\" and adding that the relief effort is under control.\r\nBut Carmen Yulin Cruz, the mayor of the U.S. island's largest city, heatedly denied that. She said on CNN: \"This is a people-are-dying story.\"     \r\nAfter being asked to clarify her remarks Thursday, Duke misspoke and said it was good news that there was a unified response to the earthquake, mixing up devastation in Puerto Rico with the damage in Mexico City after a 7.1 earthquake ten days ago.\r\nDuke was one of several members of the Trump administration Thursday to push back against reporting that the federal government was slow to respond to the storm, which knocked out power and left Puerto Rico's 3.4 million people short of food and water.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3870240eae2e3bf62b8bd59778f57a72 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
