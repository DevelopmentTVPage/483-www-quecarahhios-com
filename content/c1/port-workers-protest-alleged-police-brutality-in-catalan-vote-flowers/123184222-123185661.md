    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) Several hundred Barcelona port workers held a demonstration outside the regional headquarters of Spain's ruling Popular Party on Tuesday as tensions over the government's reaction to Sunday's referendum vote continued. \r\nThe group chanted slogans against the alleged police brutality during the disputed vote on Catalonia's secession that left hundreds of people injured.\r\nSpain called the vote illegal and invalid, and tasked the police \r\nThe protest came as several small labour unions and grassroots pro-independence groups urged workers throughout Catalonia to go on partial or full-day strikes on Tuesday to protest the police actions during Sunday's voting.\r\nThe port worker threw wads of unused ballot papers from the vote into the air outside the party's office in downtown Barcelona.\r\nRegional police placed barriers outside the building to stop the crowd getting near the offices during the protest, which lasted more than an hour.\r\nAt a large school in the centre of the Catalan capital parents and children offered floral tributes on Tuesday to honour those injured in the confrontations during the referendum. \r\nThe Ramon Llull school saw a sustained police operation to disrupt voting on Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/058beaddb2c173bc90e1d6b2e47fa29e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
