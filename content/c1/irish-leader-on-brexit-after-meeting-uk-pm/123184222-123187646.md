    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Monday said he had urged the British government to be \"more specific\" about its future relationship with Ireland following its withdrawal from the European Union.\r\nAfter talks with Prime Minister Theresa May in Downing Street in London, Varadkar said he welcomed her decision, as outlined in her Florence speech, to rule out a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland\r\nHe also said there was more that united than divided Ireland and the UK.\r\nIt was May's first meeting with a European Union (EU) leader since her keynote speech in Florence last week in which she set out her plans for Brexit.\r\nThe EU on Monday ramped up pressure on Britain ahead of a new round of Brexit talks, warning again that time is running out for May to clinch a deal.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8be6aa2a8e921384005050d7ff7d2400 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
