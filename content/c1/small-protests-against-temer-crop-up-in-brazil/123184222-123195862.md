    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Small protests in cities took place on Wednesday in Brazil as congressional vote took place that could have suspended President Michel Temer him over a bribery charge.\r\nTemer survived the vote. At least 172 of the 513 members of the lower Chamber of Deputies had voted by late on Wednesday against putting Temer on trial for allegedly orchestrating a scheme to line his own pockets with millions of dollars in illicit payments.\r\nOutside Congress in Brasilia, people carrying banners and shouting \"Out Temer\" said the lawwakers will \"pay the consequences\" of their vote in the next elections in 2018. \r\nIn Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, small groups gathered to demonstrate against Temer and to demand an investigation against him. \r\nTemer is deeply unpopular among Brazilians. The latest poll last week put his approval rating at 5 percent. Despite that, the government believes it has enough votes for Temer to survive.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c598eb2410035baee27e5f71e4c81168 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
