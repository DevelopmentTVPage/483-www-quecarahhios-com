    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) The Taliban have claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing attack earlier in the day on a NATO convoy in southern Afghanistan.\r\nQari Yusuf Ahmadi, Taliban spokesman in southern Afghanistan, claimed two armored tanks were destroyed and that 15 foreign soldiers were killed in Wednesday's attack on the outskirts of the city of Kandahar. \r\nThe insurgents, however, routinely exaggerate their gains and death tolls.\r\nUS military spokesman Lt. Damien E. Horvath had earlier confirmed the attack and said that there were casualties, but he could not say how many or provide their nationalities\r\nAhmadi identified the suicide attacker as Taliban fighter Asadullah Kandahari from southern Kandahar, saying he was a \"hero\" who carried out the attack with a small pick-up truck, packed with explosives.\r\nKandahar province was the Taliban spiritual and leadership headquarters during their five-year rule that ended in with the US invasion in 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1b01d431b6082b188a96414a8b77204c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
