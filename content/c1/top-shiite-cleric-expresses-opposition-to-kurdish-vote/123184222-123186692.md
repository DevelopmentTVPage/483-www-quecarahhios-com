    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) The representative of Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most senior Shiite cleric in Iraq commented on the recent political crisis surrounding the Kurdish referendum.\r\nIn a statement read in the Shiite holy city of Karbala by cleric Ahmad al-Safi during Friday prayers, al-Sistani said all parties in Iraq should abide by the Iraqi constitution.\r\nSistani called on the leaders of the Kurdish region and the central government to settle their differences through constitutional means.\r\nIraqi Kurds voted with overwhelming majority earlier this week to secede from Iraq, a move described by the central government as illegal and destabilising.\r\nAs a response, Baghdad shut down international access to the Kurdish airspace and its two airports, starting on Friday.\r\nSistani's pronouncements usually carry great weight, given his senior status in the clerical hierarchy and the clergy's important role in Iraqi Shiite society.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4d62f93bb9f0b43c3aea51204f162506 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
