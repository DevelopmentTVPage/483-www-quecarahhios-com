    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Two former Thai Prime Ministers arrived in court in Bangkok on Wednesday ahead of a verdict in a case filed against them over a decision to move against protesters outside parliament in October 2008, \r\nTwo people were killed and hundreds wounded in the violence.\r\nSomchai Wongsawat was prime minister and Chavalit Yongchaiyudh his deputy at the time.\r\nThe clashes turned violent after police fired tear gas to disperse protesters who were trying to block Somchai from delivering his first policy statement to lawmakers.\r\nSomchai was finally able to enter the parliament building but was then trapped inside when the protesters regrouped and blocked the exits.\r\nHe had been prime minister for two weeks when the incident happened. \r\nThe protesters wanted him out because they said he was a proxy for Thaksin Shinawatra, who had been deposed in a military coup two years before. \r\nSomchai is Thaksin's brother-in-law.\r\nCritics of the current military government see the prosecution against Somchai as a further attempt to remove the Shinawatra family from Thai political life.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4e1ebdca255a7851da7d550ffbd093a3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
