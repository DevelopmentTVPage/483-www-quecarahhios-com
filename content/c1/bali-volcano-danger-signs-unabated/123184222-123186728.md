    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) A Bali island volcano was exhibiting signs of unrest on Friday, with a continued high chance of eruption.\r\nThe observation post for Mount Agung witnessed the volcano emitting a small plume most likely of water vapour after daybreak. \r\nBut there was no ash cloud.\r\nHundreds of tremors have shaken the mountain daily since the volcanic activity began increasing last week. \r\nScientists have said the activity suggests magma is moving below the surface and may erupt, but they can't say when or how severe the eruption might be.\r\nAuthorities have declared an area up to 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) from the crater off-limits. \r\nThe more than 130,000 people who have fled are staying in community centres or other shelters in safer areas of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ac73c5fe24a6fbe21be65a09ff11b4e6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
