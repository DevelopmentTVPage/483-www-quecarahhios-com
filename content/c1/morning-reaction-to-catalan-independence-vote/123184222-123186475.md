    "description": "(2 Oct 2017) Residents of Barcelona on Monday reacted to Sunday's disputed referendum on independence from Spain, criticising the violence that resulted in more than 800 people being injured.\r\nThe referendum degenerated into mayhem on Sunday, as riot police attacked peaceful protesters and unarmed civilians trying to cast their ballots.\r\nRegional officials say 844 people were injured in clashes with police. \r\nIt wasn't immediately clear how many people were hospitalised. \r\nIn addition, 33 police officers were injured.\r\nCatalonia said preliminary poll results showed 90 percent favoured independence after under half the electorate voted and the regional government declared a landslide win for the \"yes\" side.\r\nCatalan president Carles Puigdemont is set to chair a closed-door Cabinet meeting on Monday, which is expected to consider asking the regional parliament to vote on an independence declaration later in the week.\r\nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, meanwhile, will meet with ruling Popular Party leaders before seeking a parliamentary session to discuss how to confront the country's most serious crisis in decades.\r\nHe also called an afternoon meeting with the leader of the main opposition Socialist party to discuss Spain's options.\r\nNo one knows what will happen if Catalan officials follow through on their pledge to use the vote as a basis for declaring independence, a provocation that would possible remove from Spain one of its most prosperous regions, including the coastal city of Barcelona, the regional capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4650e557a639195ad6b600b2a78068dd \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
