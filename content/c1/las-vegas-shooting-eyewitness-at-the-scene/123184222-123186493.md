She said she heard a noise that sounded like \"pop, pop, pop\" and initially thought it was fireworks or firecrackers. \r\nShe said people were crouching down.\r\nA Las Vegas hospital says at least two people are dead and dozens wounded after the shooting.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6fe51d5b23f181c55a6aa689ade06305 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
