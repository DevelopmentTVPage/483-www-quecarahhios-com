    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) Survivors from Thursday night's shipwreck in Bangladesh tried to face life in their new home on Saturday, an overcrowded, unsanitary refugee camp, with their minds focused on loved ones who perished when the boat struck a rock and sank.\r\nThirteen Rohingya Muslims, some of them orphaned children, sat in silence together in a hut at the Kutupalong camp, awaiting officialdom to absorb them into its teeming masses. \r\nSome cried, others stared straight ahead, still shocked by the tragedy.\r\nAhmed Hossain was on the shore that night. \r\nHe says he leapt into the sea to try to pull the terrified refugees from the water.\r\nHaving survived the sinking, now they have to learn to survive again, this time in a fetid refugee camp. \r\nKutupalong has doubled in size since the exodus of Rohingya began a month ago, straining the ability of aid agencies and the Bangladesh government to cope.\r\n20-year-old Noor Fatima lost one child in the tragedy. \r\nWas fleeing the dangers of Myanmar worth the loss, and the life she must now lead?\r\n\"I lost my child, but why would I want to go back to Myanmar?\" she said without hesitation. \r\n\"I want to forget about that country.\"\r\nThey were fleeing from recent violence in Myanmar when their overcrowded boat capsized in rough weather near shore in the Bay of Bengal. \r\nThe UN migration agency said on Friday that more than 60 people were either confirmed dead or missing and presumed dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/500bbc5ec46ce27dac4ef7c6f53c0d0a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
