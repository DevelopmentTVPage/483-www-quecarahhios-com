    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Lines for fuel and laundry were not for the feint of heart in Puerto Rico Friday.\r\nA miles long queue of cars were parked on the side of the freeway with people waiting to be able to fill up their tanks.\r\nOne happy customer smiled and told the AP reporter that the situation had \"improved a lot\" comparing it to not being able to get fuel at all.\r\nIn another part of town, people were diligently and patiently waiting their turn  to do their laundry at a laundromat that had electricity and was open 24 hours a day, seven days a week to accommodate the need.\r\nCustomers were waiting long hours to do just two loads of laundry.   \r\nCategory 4 Hurricane Maria devastated the US territory of 3.4 million people last week, destroying homes and businesses. It is blamed for 16 deaths on the island.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c38717007b718ace0109cf1edeca3105 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
