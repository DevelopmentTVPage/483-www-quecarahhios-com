    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) Venezuela opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez never violated the conditions of his house arrest, his lawyer told a news conference in Caracas on Tuesday.  \r\nJuan Carlos Gutierrez said the 46-year-old Lopez was pulled from his home and was taken to the Ramo Verde prison. \r\nThe nation's highest court has said Lopez and former mayor Antonio Ledezma were removed from their homes early Tuesday after \"official intelligence sources\" determined there was an \"escape plan\" involving both men.\r\nVenezuela's Supreme Court also said the two leading opposition figures have been jailed because they violated the terms of their house arrest.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4b5a12d3237203053661ae4abfe612da \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
