    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) Some 300 volunteers used 100 tons of plastic bottle caps to form a giant mosaic on a square in the northern Serbian city of Novi Sad on Saturday.\r\nThe humanitarian organisation 'The Bottle Cap for the Handicapped' organised the event in an effort to raise awareness about dangers to ecology and to raise aid for disabled children. \r\nThe bottle caps that are collected are sent to a recycling plant and the funds are used to purchase whatever equipment disabled children need.\r\nThe planned, 600-square-metre (yards) picture will be nominated for a Guinness world record.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/72da5b159d4a7b8b3cfef954d1451283 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
