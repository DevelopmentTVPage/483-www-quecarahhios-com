    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) The White House says President Donald Trump has not yet signed a sanctions bill that landed on his desk last week, which includes new sanctions on Russia.\r\nPress secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Tuesday that the president \"has not\" signed it, but \"he will.\"\r\nShe says, \"there's a review process, a legal process.\"\r\nA White House statement Friday said Trump \"has now reviewed the final version and, based on its responsiveness to his negotiations, approves the bill and intends to sign it.\"\r\nThe package of stiff financial sanctions against Russia passed Congress with overwhelming support.\r\nMoscow responded to the White House statement last weekend by ordering a reduction in the number of U.S. diplomats in Russia.\r\nSanders also reiterated that the president was only making a comment when he spoke to police about handling suspects.\r\n\"I think you guys are jumping and trying to make something out of nothing, he was simply making a comment, making a joke and it was nothing more than that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ca9c566072d7026ff2a5c56cebbb4802 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
