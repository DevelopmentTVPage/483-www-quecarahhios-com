    "description": "(22 Sep 2017) Turkish citizens have mixed thoughts about Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region's upcoming referendum on independence.\r\n\"They should abandon this referendum immediately. They should abandon this and they should know their place as a neighbour,\" said Gurcan Kucuktas, a 72 year-old Turkish citizen. \r\nHowever, 57 year-old Burhan who refused to share his surname said he thinks this referendum will have benefits for Turkey. \r\n\"It's a country with five million citizens; it won't have a chance to challenge Turkey. They cannot move anywhere without us (Turkey). Let them govern themselves; then they can contribute to our welfare,\" he said.\r\nAccording to Ahmet Kasim Han, an International Relations professor at Istanbul's Kadir Has University, both public opinion and politics are divided on the meaning of this referendum. \r\nA senior Turkish official said on Thursday that Turkey's parliament will convene for an emergency session as Ankara mounts pressure on Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region to cancel a referendum on independence.\r\nRuling party legislator Mustafa Elitas said Thursday that parliament - which is currently on recess - will meet on Saturday, two days before the referendum which Turkey has branded as a national security threat.\r\nTurkey is also holding a National Security Council, followed by a Cabinet meeting on Friday to mull a response to the referendum.\r\nThis week, the military launched previously unannounced military exercises near the border with Iraq.\r\nThe referendum is scheduled for September 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6d0183c99932092fe7d3cffb4109c433 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
