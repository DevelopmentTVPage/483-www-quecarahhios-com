    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) In an impromptu news conference on the White House's South Lawn Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump predicted Republicans would be able to pass health care reform in the future, weighed in on the overnight Republican primary race in Alabama and continued his campaign against the NFL.\r\nRoy Moore prevailed Tuesday in a Republican primary runoff by defeating an opponent backed by both President Donald Trump and deep-pocketed allies of Sen. Mitch McConnell.\r\nTrump spoke also about his unhappiness with HHS Secretary Tom Price's extensive use of private planes.\r\nOn the proposed corporate tax rate, Trump said that a 20 percent rate was his \"red line\" and that it had always been his goal.\r\n\"In fact, I wanted to start at 15 so that we got 20,\" he said, adding: \"20s my number.\"\r\nUnder the plan, corporations would see their top tax rate cut from 35 percent to 20 percent.\r\nTrump also delivered a new message for the NFL: Change or business is \"going to go to hell.\"\r\nTrump said that the NFL is in a \"really bad box\" over the issue of players kneeling in protest during the national anthem. He said ratings are falling, and the only thing doing well is the NFL pregame show.\r\n\"You cannot have people disrespecting our national anthem, our flag, our country,\" Trump told reporters as he departed the White House for a trip to Indiana. \"In my opinion, the NFL has to change. Or you know what's going to happen. Their business is going to go to hell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/eb71de4a5a1156e56cc6621441cb649c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
