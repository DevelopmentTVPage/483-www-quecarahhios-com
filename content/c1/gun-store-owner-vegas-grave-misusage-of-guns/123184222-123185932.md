    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) The man who unleashed hundreds of rounds of gunfire on a crowd of concertgoers in Las Vegas had two accessories that could have allowed his semi-automatic rifles to fire rapidly and continuously, as if they were fully automatic weapons, officials said.\r\nThough legally and widely available, the so-called \"bump stocks\" have attracted scrutiny from authorities and lawmakers in recent years.\r\nA semi-automatic weapon requires one trigger pull for each round fired. With a fully automatic firearm, one trigger pull can unleash continuous rounds until the magazine is empty. The bump-stock devices work by manipulating the trigger mechanism extremely rapidly, far faster than a person could do so without them.\r\nAuthorities found two bump stocks in Paddock's hotel room, two officials familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press. They are investigating whether those items were used to modify weapons used in the massacre, according to the officials, who were briefed by law enforcement and spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still unfolding. Sheriff Joseph Lombardo hasn't said whether they played a role in the rampage.\r\nTroy Michelin, the owner of Crosshairs Texas, in Bastrop, Texas, demonstrated how to install a \"bump stock\" for the Associated Press. Michelin said the modifications typically retail between $150-to-$200. Michalik says he sells only a handful of \"bump stocks\" in any given year, adding that there has been an uptick of ammo sales at his store, but not the stocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/466ac536f2699d2b17398f25ec9572fa \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
