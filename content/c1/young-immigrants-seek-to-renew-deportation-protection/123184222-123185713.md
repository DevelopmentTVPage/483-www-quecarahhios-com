    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) Tens of thousands of young immigrants have reapplied for the programme protecting them from deportation, hoping this renewal won't be the last time they're able to stay in the country they've called home since childhood. \r\nMore than 112,000 renewals for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program, or DACA, had been sent to federal government as of Wednesday, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. \r\nThursday was the deadline for the 154,000 recipients eligible to reapply.\r\nThe rush of paperwork was prompted by the Trump's Administration's announcement in September that DACA would be phased out in March. \r\nUntil then, the Trump Administration said Congress needed to address the issue of immigrants who were brought to this country by their parents as children. DACA was created by President Barack Obama in 2012 and nearly 700,000 immigrants were under the programme.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8082a5ee4813f883fe52791ead123ffd \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
