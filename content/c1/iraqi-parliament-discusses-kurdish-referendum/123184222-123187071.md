    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) Iraq's prime minister has ruled out the use of force in the government's confrontation with the Kurdish region after it held a referendum on independence that was rejected by Baghdad and neighbouring countries.\r\nHaider al-Abadi told lawmakers on Wednesday that he will \"impose federal authority in the whole of Iraq, including in the (Kurdish) region with the force of the constitution and the force of law\".\r\nParliament has approved a 13-point resolution that gives al-Abadi the mandate to deploy troops in the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and other disputed territories that are controlled by Kurdish forces, but are outside the autonomous Kurdish region.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1859eef49b17b19529d9f27ba50a784a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
