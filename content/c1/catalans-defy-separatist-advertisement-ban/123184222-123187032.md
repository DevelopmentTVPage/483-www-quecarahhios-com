    "description": "(28 Sep 2017) People in the Spanish autonomous region of Catalonia continue to defy the central government's prohibition of pro-independence referendum advertising in the streets, ahead of the vote on Sunday 1 October.\r\nGracia neighbourhood, right in the middle of the city of Barcelona, has historically been a stronghold of separatism.\r\nEvery night since 20 September, a group of youngsters, led by academic and political science investigator Jordi Graupera, print posters advertising the referendum.\r\nThe ads are replicas of the ones designed by the Catalan regional government and were later deemed illegal by Madrid\u2019s judicial authorities.\r\nThousands of people supporting the contested referendum to split Catalonia from Spain took to Barcelona\u2019s streets last week, amid an intensifying government crackdown on the independence vote.\r\nSpanish authorities arrested a dozen regional officials and seized over a million ballot papers and banners advertising the referendum.\r\nOnly hours after the detentions, websites containing replicas of the banners and asking sympathisers to print them mushroomed the internet.\r\nJordi Graupera created the website \"empaperem.cat\" (Catalan for \"let\u2019s glue those ads\"), which was later closed by the Spanish police force, the Guardia Civil.\r\nGraupera currently lives in the United States, where he teaches and investigates political science at Princeton University.\r\nHe says there are dozens of other citizens' groups like his doing the same throughout Catalonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/74f7c1a04ebd57771f726dc44fccfd74 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
