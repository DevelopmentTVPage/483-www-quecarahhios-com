    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) Catalonia's regional leader has condemned the Spanish police crackdown on people trying to vote in the disputed independence referendum.\r\nCatalan President Carles Puigdemont said that \"police brutality will shame forever the Spanish state\" after police smashed their way into voting centers and fired rubber bullets to disperse crowds.\r\nPolice have been ordered to prevent the vote from taking place.\r\nPuigdemont was welcomed by cheering crowds at the gymnasium where police broke in to halt voting. The Catalan leader was meant to vote there in Sant Julia e Ramis but had to choose a different polling center instead.\r\nHe said the Spanish government had damaged itself by its actions.\r\nPuigdemont said that \"today, the Spanish state has lost much more than what it had already lost, while Catalonia has won.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/20164ef99dbed537c08f825008b7a31b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
