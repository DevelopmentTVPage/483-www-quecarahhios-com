    "description": "(24 Sep 2017) German voters were casting their ballots on Sunday morning in the country's national election in which Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking a fourth term. \r\nFinal preparations were also underway for the 44th 'BMW Berlin Marathon', expected to take place later on the day. \r\nMerkel's conservative bloc of the Christian Democratic Party and Bavarian-only Christian Social Union has a healthy lead in the polls.\r\nMerkel's main challenger is Social Democrat Martin Schulz. \r\nGerman voters will elect their new parliament on Sunday, but don't expect a new government to be in place next week.\r\nWith the seats expected to be spread across up to six caucuses, there's very little chance of anyone winning a majority to govern alone. \r\nAfter voters have had their say, it's down to Germany's political parties to put together a coalition to govern for the next four years.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/b967692e3a3db68ca5e40e3645c232d4 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
