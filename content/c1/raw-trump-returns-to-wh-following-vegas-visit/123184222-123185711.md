    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania landed in Washington following a somber Wednesday spent at hospital bedsides and at a vital police base in stricken Las Vegas. \r\nTrump offered prayers and condolences to the victims of Sunday night's shooting massacre during his daylong trip. He also thanked the nation's first responders and doctors who rushed to save lives. \r\n\"America is truly a nation in mourning,\" he said, before adding that many families \"tonight will go to bed in a world that is suddenly empty.\" \r\nIt was a somber address from a provocateur president who prides himself on commanding strength but sometimes has struggled to project empathy at times of tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/f4980a3911c60f8e8aa9c0742e3a259a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
