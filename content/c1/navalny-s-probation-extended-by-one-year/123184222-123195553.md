    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) A Russian court extended the probation of opposition leader Alexei Navalny by one year on Friday, a sentence that should bar him from running for office until at least 2021.\r\nNavalny, who rose to prominence with his investigations of official corruption, spearheaded a series of anti-corruption protests across Russia this year, the most wide-spread in decades.\r\nHe wants to run for president of Russia next year and has been signing up campaign volunteers even though he is technically ineligible as a candidate. \r\nHe says banning him from office is illegal and he's campaigning to put pressure on authorities.\r\nA lawyer by training, Navalny was convicted of fraud in 2013 and 2014 after trials that supporters characterised as politically motivated.\r\nHe was given a five-year suspended prison sentence along with one-and-a-half years' probation this year after a retrial of one of the cases.\r\nThe court in Moscow granted a motion filed by penitentiary officials who asked for Navalny to be kept on probation for a year longer, until December 2020.\r\nThe officials argued that he has repeatedly violated the terms of his suspended sentence.\r\nNavalny has signed up more than 130,000 volunteers in more than 60 cities across Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ad28b3ad8fe6b8e32c903377976e4128 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
