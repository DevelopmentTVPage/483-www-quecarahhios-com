    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) British Prime Minister Theresa May held talks at Downing Street on Monday with Irish premier Leo Varadkar.\r\nIt is May's first meeting with a European Union (EU) leader since her keynote Florence speech, in which she set out her plans for Brexit.\r\nVaradkar said he wanted to ensure a close relationship between Ireland and the UK is maintained post-Brexit, and that the common travel area remained in place.\r\nThe EU on Monday ramped up pressure on Britain ahead of a new round of Brexit talks, warning again that time is running out for May to clinch a deal.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/087f59e19118a84c4f0a031c043fbb5c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
