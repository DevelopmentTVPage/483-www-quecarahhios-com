    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) President Donald Trump defended his administration's response to the devastation in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. \r\n\"We have done an incredible job considering there's absolutely nothing to work with, President Trump said.  \r\nHe has received criticism for acting slowly to send help to the U.S. territory. \r\nPresident Trump also said some \"very bad things\" happened to American diplomats who were harmed by unexplained health \"attacks\" in Cuba.\r\nHe offered his first public comments on the attacks that have harmed at least 21 American diplomats and their families. He responded to a shouted question before departing the White House, hours after the State Department announced it is pulling more than half its diplomats out of Havana.\r\nTrump said there was a \"big problem\" in Cuba. He said \"they did some very bad things.\" But he did not specify who he believes is responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/2ef7ed9f038fa52e43a9e374c236af23 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
