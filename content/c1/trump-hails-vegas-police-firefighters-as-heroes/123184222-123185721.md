    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) President Donald Trump met with police, firefighters and cab drivers who ferried those wounded in the Las Vegas shooting to hospitals and congratulated them on their professionalism and hailed them as heroes. \r\nTrump called the suspect a \"sick, demented man.'' \r\nSheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department pointed to two young women in the room and identified them as dispatchers who were amazing. He said there would be a third female dispatcher in the room but she decided to go to a beach in Mexico. \r\n\"She needed a break, and a margarita,'' one of her fellow dispatchers said.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/e76c73eb08faec67a8709fc221dd44d5 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
