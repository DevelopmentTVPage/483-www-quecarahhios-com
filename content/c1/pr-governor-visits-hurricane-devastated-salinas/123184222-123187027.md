    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) Governor Ricardo Rossello flew to the Puerto Rico southern coastal town of Salinas on Wednesday. \r\nSalinas Mayor Karilyn Bonilla said 50 percent of Salinas is without water, especially in the mountain region. \r\n\"The inspections that we have done in rural areas, 80 per cent of wooden houses (were damaged or completely destroyed),\" Bonilla said.\r\nRossello said the main problem is getting enough trucks and drivers to reach people throughout the island, adding that he is getting help from the US mainland including National Guard troops from several states. \r\nRossello said Puerto Rico intends to seek more than a billion dollars in federal assistance and they have praised the response to the disaster by President Donald Trump.\r\nOfficials say due to the mix of topography, residents in the mountains and low-lying areas are experiencing their own, logistical issues while the government struggles with few resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6162b2f22cc1c2bae2c511ff7ce51feb \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
