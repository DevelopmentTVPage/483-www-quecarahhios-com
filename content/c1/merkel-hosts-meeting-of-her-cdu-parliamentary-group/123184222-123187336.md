    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) German Chancellor Angela Merkel's newly elected CDU parliamentary group met for the first time inside the Bundestag on Tuesday.\r\nGerman parties' newly elected parliamentary groups were holding their first meetings after an election that left Merkel's conservative bloc weakened, but still on top. \r\nIt now faces a complicated task of forming a coalition government and the prospect of robust opposition from both the right and left.\r\nThe most politically plausible option is a three-way coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats and the traditionally left-leaning Greens. \r\nThe combination, called a \"Jamaica\" coalition because the parties' colours match those of the Caribbean nation's flag, hasn't been tried before in a national government.\r\nMerkel will have to bridge differences between the Free Democrats and Greens. \r\nThe parties have a tradition of mutual suspicion as well as differences on issues including environmental policy, European financial policy and the motor industry's future.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ff94606be2ebff245695ca2ac020f59b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
