    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) Thousands of Spaniards protesting against Sunday's Catalan referendum gathered in Placa de Sant Jaume, central Barcelona on Saturday to demonstrate against the vote deemed by the Spanish government to be illegal.\r\nOne protester climbed up the wall of a building and tried to pull down a banner reading \"more democracy.\"\r\nMembers of the crowd could be seen throwing eggs at the sign.\r\nSpain and its most powerful and prosperous region are headed for a showdown on Sunday with the planned staging of the independence referendum, deemed by the Spanish government to be illegal.\r\nAs eyes around the globe watch to see whether the region will actually try to secede from Spain, a country that has existed for some 500 years, the number of people who turn out to vote will be a key element.\r\nCatalan authorities have pledged to make the voting possible even if police, acting on judges' orders, manages to close polling stations and seal off ballot boxes.\r\nIf a 'yes' vote wins, they have promised to declare independence within 48 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/f3ccd28fe8eae79fa07463a85b51a7d7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
