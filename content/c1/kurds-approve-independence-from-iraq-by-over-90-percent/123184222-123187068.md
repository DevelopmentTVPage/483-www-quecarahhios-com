    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) The Kurdish referendum on independence from Iraq was approved by more than 92 percent of voters, officials said on Wednesday, as Iraq's prime minister vowed to keep his country united without resorting to the use of force.\r\nHendrin Mohammed, the head of the Kurdish region's election commission, announced the official results at a press conference, saying the referendum passed with 92.73 percent support and turnout of more than 72 percent.\r\nEven with the strong support, the non-binding vote is unlikely to lead to formal independence, but it has escalated long-running tensions with Baghdad, which has moved to block flights in and out of the Kurds' autonomous region. \r\nIraq and its neighbours, along with virtually the entire international community, are opposed to any redrawing of the map.\r\nThe vote was held across the autonomous Kurdish region's three provinces as well as in some disputed territories controlled by Kurdish forces but claimed by Baghdad.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/166cf79f79f18781e70d3c80abdd16a3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
