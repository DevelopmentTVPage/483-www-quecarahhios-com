    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) The president of the Brazilian Olympic Committee was arrested on Thursday amid an investigation into a vote-buying scheme to bring the Olympics to Rio de Janeiro last year.\r\nCarlos Nuzman, who is also an honorary International Olympic Committee member, was held for questioning last month by Brazilian and French authorities. \r\nThey say he is a central figure in channelling 2 million US dollars to Lamine Diack, a former IOC member from Senegal who helped secure votes when Rio was picked by the IOC in 2009.\r\nLeonardo Gryner, director-general of operations for the organising committee, was also arrested Thursday morning.\r\nBrazilian authorities have said the behind-the-scenes dealings to win the vote amounted to a \"criminal organisation.\"\r\nThe 75-year-old Nuzman was one of the most prominent figures in bringing the games to Rio.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ed1d4c78799a129181a1fedfd86af80e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
