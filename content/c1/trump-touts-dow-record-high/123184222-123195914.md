    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Following an announcement about legislation to overhaul the U.S. immigration system, President Donald Trump touted the record high of the Dow Jones industrial average, saying \"we picked up four trillion dollars in net worth.\" \r\nThe president also pointed to plans by the Foxconn Technology Group to invest $10 billion dollars in a plant in Wisconsin.\r\n\"You're going to see jobs are pouring back into the country. Factories, and plants are coming back into the country,\" he said.\r\nThe president repeated his claim the Taiwanese electronics company would ultimately invest $30 billion in the U.S., which he has said the company's leader told him off the record. \r\nFoxconn reiterated in a statement Wednesday that the Wisconsin plant \"will be the first of a series of facilities we will be building in several states.\" It did not address Trump's statement about the total investment amount or Trump's claims that the company's head told it to him in confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cce0872fd809c3a46a4e027e74fcad98 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
