    "description": "(28 Sep 2017) Russian President Vladimir Putin was greeted by his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Thursday. \r\nPutin is in Turkey for talks with Erdogan on developments in Iraq and Syria, and Turkey's decision to purchase a Russian-made missile defence system.\r\nThe Russian leader's visit comes as Turkey and Russia are deepening ties in a turnaround for the two nations, which have backed opposing sides in Syria and nearly came to blows over Turkey's downing of a Russian plane in 2015.\r\nRussia and Turkey, together with Iran, are now working on setting up de-escalation zones in Syria that have helped reduce fighting.\r\nOn Iraq, Turkey has strongly opposed an Iraqi Kurdish referendum on independence which Russia neither supported nor condemned.\r\nSome of Turkey's NATO allies have expressed concern over Turkey's decision to purchase the Russia's S-400 missile defence system.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/15c185d640f53ba8b33d1c08f0cadc6a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
