    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) Children make up about 60 percent of the estimated half-a-million Rohingya Muslims who have poured into Bangladesh over the last five weeks to flee persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, according to UNICEF.\r\nAmong them are newborn babies, who are becoming sick and malnourished as their parents struggle to find food, clean water and toilets in the camps and temporary shelters teeming with Rohingya refugees.\r\nKhadija Khatun and her husband Syed Nur crossed over from Myanmar on 26 August to escape the violence.\r\nMohammed Toha, now 16-days old, was born in the medical clinic at the Kutupalong camp.\r\nThe baby has been sick ever since.\r\nA heavily pregnant Khaleda Begum fled from her violence-wracked village Mondu in Myanmar, walking for four days before arriving in Bangladesh on September 11. \r\nOn September 19 she gave birth to Shafika.\r\nBoth mother and child are malnourished.\r\nMany young children have turned caretakers for their infant siblings as their impoverished parents queue up to collect relief supplies.\r\nDoctors at the medical clinic in Kutupalong say there is an acute shortage of resources to treat newborn babies suffering from sepsis , respiratory tract infections and low birth weight.\r\nDoctor Abdullah Al Sufian, the Medical Officer treating infants at the medical clinic in Kutupalong refugee camp, said the Rohingya mothers were not able to look after their young children.\r\nInternational aid agencies are calling for a scaling up of the humanitarian response in Bangladesh to provide support to the Rohingya refugee families desperately in need.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/d344fe32f3497eec71424a981146e299 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
