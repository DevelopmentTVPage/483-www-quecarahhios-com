    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) Former \"Let's Make a Deal\" host Monty Hall has died. He was 96. Hall co-created \"Let's Make a Deal,\" which debuted on NBC in 1963 and became a TV staple for decades. Contestants chosen from the studio audience wore outlandish costumes to attract Hall's attention. The game involved swapping prize items for others hidden behind doors, curtains or in boxes.And with the wealth that the game show brought, he made philanthropy and fundraising his avocation. Sharon Hall says her father died Saturday morning of heart failure at his home in Beverly Hills, California.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/b02e95342a9a1c60ae86b72710f6b89a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
