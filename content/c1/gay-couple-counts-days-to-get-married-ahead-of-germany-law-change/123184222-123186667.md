    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Gay couples living in Germany prepared to welcome a long-awaited law legalizing same-sex marriage, which comes into effect on Sunday.\r\nThe law brings Germany in line with many of its Western peers.\r\nBodo Mende and Karl Kreile, both born in 1957, and living and working as civil servants in Berlin, met on 14 July in 1979.  \r\nNow they are counting the days to finally get married on Sunday morning.\r\n\"We no longer have a second-class partnership, but finally have a partnership equal to all the other heterosexual partnerships, which are working just as good or just as bad as homosexual partnerships,\" said Bodo Mende.\r\nGermany has allowed same-sex couples to enter civil partnerships since 2001, but had not granted them full marital rights, which include the possibility to jointly adopt children. \r\nChancellor Angela Merkel voted against the measure, but paved the way for its passage by allowing members of her conservative party to vote according to their conscience.\r\nLawmakers voted 393-226 to legalize \"marriage for everybody,\" with four abstentions.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/2f95ff6b6d6da33862a86509f69de549 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
