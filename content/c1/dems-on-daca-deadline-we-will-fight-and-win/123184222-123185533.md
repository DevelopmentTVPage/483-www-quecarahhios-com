    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) Democratic members of Congress held a rally outside the Capitol Thursday, the deadline day for immigrants living in the country illegally to submit their application to stay in the United States under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \r\nNearly 800,000 immigrants who came into the U.S. as children have until the end of the day to renew their immigration status or face deportation.\r\nFulfilling a campaign promise, President Donald Trump rescinded the DACA program last month, but giving Congress six months to draft a more lasting fix. \r\nDemocratic leaders and Trump claim they have reached a deal to protect the immigrants, but Congress has since turned its focus to overhauling the tax code. \r\nAt the rally Thursday morning, Democratic lawmakers pledged to fight until Congress passes a bill allowing DACA recipients to remain in the U.S. legally.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/57652d399bd075e66a1f5cfc3c797779 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
