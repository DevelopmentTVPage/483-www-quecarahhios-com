    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) U.S. President Donald Trump is calling the current American tax system a \"relic\" and a \"colossal barrier\" that's standing in the way of the nation's economic comeback.\r\nSpeaking at an event in Indianapolis that his tax proposal will help middle-class families save money and will eliminate loopholes that benefit the wealthy.\r\nTrump says the wealthy \"can call me all they want. It's not going to help.\" The billionaire president says he's \"doing the right thing. And it's not good for me, believe me.\"\r\nThe president says under his plan, \"the vast majority of families will be able to file their taxes on a single sheet of paper.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/93c7dbbd0233aa9a6b3996fa878655c3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
