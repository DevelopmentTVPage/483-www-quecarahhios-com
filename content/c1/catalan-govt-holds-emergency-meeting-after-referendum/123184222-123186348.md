    "description": "(2 Oct 2017) Catalonia's government held a closed-door Cabinet meeting on Monday to discuss the next steps in its plan to declare independence from Spain following a disputed referendum marred by violence. \r\nCatalonia said preliminary poll results showed 90 percent favored independence after under half the electorate voted in a day that saw around 850 people injured in clashes with police.\r\nSpain insists the referendum was illegal and invalid.\r\nThe referendum debacle brought Spain and Catalonia closer to a potentially disastrous showdown as each side said Sunday's events proved them right and neither looked prepared to cede ground.\r\nCatalan president Carles Puigdemont chaired the Cabinet meeting, which was expected to include discussions over asking the regional parliament to vote on an historic independence declaration later in the week.\r\nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, meanwhile, will meet with ruling Popular Party leaders before seeking a parliamentary session to discuss how to confront the country's most serious crisis in decades.\r\nHe also called an afternoon meeting with the leader of the main opposition Socialist party to discuss Spain's options.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ecc9e17f322c9bc7d4140e7a1ff77dbe \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
