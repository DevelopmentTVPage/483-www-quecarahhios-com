    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) A judge says the woman who sent her boyfriend dozens of text messages urging him to kill himself won't have to be jailed until her appeals in Massachusetts are exhausted.\r\nTaunton Juvenile Court Judge Lawrence Moniz allowed Michelle Carter to return home after sentencing her Thursday to a 15-month jail term plus five years' probation. Her lawyers had asked for the stay.\r\nThe judge ordered the 20-year-old Carter to stay away from the family of 18-year-old Conrad Roy III, who killed himself in 2014 by pumping toxic gas into his truck.\r\nCarter was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in June. Moniz ruled that Carter caused Roy's death when she told him to \"get back in\" his truck as it was filling with carbon monoxide.\r\nThe judge called the case \"a tragedy for two families.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/f6e75cab74b6f2d0d689379b3908baf0 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
