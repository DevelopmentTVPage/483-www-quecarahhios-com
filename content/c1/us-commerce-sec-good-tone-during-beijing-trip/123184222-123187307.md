    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Tuesday there was a good tone during his trip to Beijing to meet Chinese officials in advance of President Donald Trump's visit later this year amid growing trade frictions.\r\nRoss was speaking at a conference in Hong Kong, where he arrived after a stop in Beijing as part of a three-nation Asian tour. \r\nWhile in Beijing, he met with Premier Li Keqiang, the country's top economic official, to prepare for Trump's visit and a senior trade mission led by Ross expected in November.\r\nChinese President Xi Jinping and Trump met when Xi visited the US in April.\r\nRoss said that while in Beijing he was organising things for Trump's visit in November.\r\n\"The tone, I felt, was pretty good,\" he said. \"But there's a lot of miles and a lot of negotiations between now and November.\"\r\nTrump has slammed China's large trade surpluses with the United States and threatened to hike tariffs on steel. \r\nHe has ordered an investigation into whether Beijing improperly pressures companies to hand over their technology in exchange for market access.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/305de10c98f003852474e9d0ec6fc641 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
