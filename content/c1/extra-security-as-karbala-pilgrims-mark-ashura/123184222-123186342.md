    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) Extra security measures were in place in the city of Karbala on Saturday as pilgrims began to celebrate Ashura, the 10th day of Muharram, a major Shiite holiday.\r\nOn this day, Shiites commemorate the death of Hussein, the grandson of Mohammed, in the battle of Karbala in 680, a foundational event in Shiite tradition.\r\nExtra security measures are normally in place at such events as Sunni extremists in Iraq have frequently targeted Shiite religious processions.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/821bd0245b2c57853aee424ef4ffda12 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
