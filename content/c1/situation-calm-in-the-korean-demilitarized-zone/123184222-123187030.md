    "description": "(28 Sep 2017) Amid tensions between the United States and North Korea, there was no special movement observed from the North Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on Thursday. \r\nPanmunjom is where an armistice was signed to pause the 1950-53 Korean War, with North Korea and China on one side and the American-led UN Command on the other.\r\nNo civilians live there, and a cluster of blue huts form a Joint Security Area overseen by North Korea and the UN Command.\r\nIt's located in the 248-kilometre (154-mile)-long Demilitarized Zone that forms the de facto Korean border. \r\nThe DMZ is guarded on both sides by hundreds of thousands of combat-ready troops, razor-wire fences and tank traps. \r\nMore than a million mines are believed to be buried inside it.\r\nToday also marks the South Korea's 69th Armed Forces Day and South Korean president Moon Jae-in said that South Korea's aim has not changed in making Korean peninsula denuclearised.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/db9fc78a14afb3d57da7cba2d828687f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
