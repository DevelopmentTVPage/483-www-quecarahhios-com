    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) People rallied in Sol Square in Madrid on Sunday to protest against the Catalan independence vote. \r\nThe protest came as Spanish government and its security forces were trying to prevent voting, which is backed by Catalan regional authorities. \r\nIn Barcelona, several people were injured as Spanish riot police smashed their way into polling stations and fired rubber bullets at protesters outside a polling station. \r\nSpain's Constitutional Court has suspended the vote. \r\nRegional separatist leaders pledged to hold it anyway, promising to declare independence if the \"yes\" side wins, and have called on 5.3 million eligible voters to cast ballots.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/0adba4cf9306f53db4179b4cccc916eb \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
