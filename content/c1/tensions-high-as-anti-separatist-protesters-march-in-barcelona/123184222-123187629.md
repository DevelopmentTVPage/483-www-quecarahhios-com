    "description": "(22 Sep 2017) Hundreds of anti-Catalan-separatist protesters on Friday held a rally in Barcelona, with many directing their anger towards pro-separatist onlookers.\r\nThough tensions were high, there were no major, violent clashes.\r\nAfter a few minutes tense minutes in front of the separatist civil association headquarters, the protesters marched towards a Guardia Civil police station.\r\nEarlier on Friday, a Catalan regional judge ordered the release with restrictions of six people arrested Wednesday in the crackdown on referendum preparations. \r\nA statement said the six declined to testify.\r\nThey remain under investigation for disobedience, abuse of power and embezzlement in relation to the planned ballot and must appear before the court each week.\r\nCatalonia represents a fifth of Spain's 1.1-trillion-euro (1.32 trillion US dollars) economy and enjoys wide self-government. \r\nThe region has about 5.5 million eligible voters. \r\nPolls consistently show the region's inhabitants favour holding a referendum but are roughly evenly divided over independence from Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3f0a27725bb377d06f12bf12415c0517 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
