    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) Iraqi troops have retaken the northern town of Hawija from the Islamic State group, driving the extremists from one of their last strongholds in the country.\r\nOn Thursday, vehicles and soldiers from the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), which are Iraqi government-sanctioned Shiite militias, were inside Hawija.\r\nIraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory during a press conference in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron. \r\nIraqi forces have driven IS from nearly all the cities and towns it seized in the summer of 2014, including the country's second largest city, Mosul, which was liberated in July. \r\nThe extremists are now mainly concentrated in a region straddling the Iraqi-Syrian border, and still control a cluster of towns in the far west of Iraq's sprawling Anbar province, where another US-backed Iraqi offensive is underway.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/7ef02cc5969fbf899eea9f965f15a677 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
