    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) Impromptu memorials to victims and rescuers have sprung up, as the capital begins to come to terms with its losses after 38 buildings collapsed in Mexico's 7.1 earthquake.\r\nIt is part of a process of grieving, remembering and paying homage to the victims as well as the volunteers and first responders who toiled for days to rescue survivors and recover the bodies of the more than 350 people who died.\r\nWhite flowers and wreaths were piled up at a previously-existing statue of a family located a close to the site where a school building collapsed, killing 19 children seven adults. \r\nThat tragedy became an international symbol of the quake, as attention focused on the effort to rescue children.\r\nSome of the monuments were less formal and more improvised.\r\nSome of the memorials were more political in tone.\r\nAt the site of a collapsed five-storey office and factory building near the city centre, the rubble has already been cleared. \r\nWhat was left was the concrete foundation and an empty plot with the building's footprint, where people left flowers and memorials scattered amongs the buckets which volunteer rescuers had used to carefully remove rubble in the first days of the rescue attempts.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/65b7f6cfedf6d8fe13600bb5fa2dacec \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
