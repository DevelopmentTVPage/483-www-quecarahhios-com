    "description": "(24 Sep 2017) Ballot papers were being prepared in Irbil on Sunday, one day before Iraq's Kurds were expected to vote in a referendum to decide whether they should secede from Iraq.\r\nA school in the Christian neighbourhood of Ankawa was emptying classrooms and getting ballot boxes ready. \r\nElection officer Nobil Boutros said election material had been received. \r\nIrbil is the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of Iraq.\r\nThe vote, which is due to go ahead on Monday, has stirred passions in the semi-autonomous region which has long had a troubled relationship with the central government.\r\nNo polls have been published but the referendum result is expected to be overwhelmingly in favour of independence.\r\nThe referendum has been dismissed by Baghdad as destabilising and illegal.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/de193aea9d270688d0cdb65403752a18 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
