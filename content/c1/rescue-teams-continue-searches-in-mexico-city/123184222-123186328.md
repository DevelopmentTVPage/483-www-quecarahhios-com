    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) Across Mexico City at sites where buildings and homes collapsed during the recent earthquake, people are showing their appreciation and respect for the efforts made by first responders and search teams.\r\nAt what is left of an office building in Colonia Roma Norte, the only site where rescue and recovery activity can be still be seen, residents hand out food to those who continue with the effort despite knowing that the chances of finding someone alive is so slim. \r\nThe death toll from Mexico's magnitude 7.1 earthquake rose by two on Saturday and now stands at 360.\r\nIt includes 219 deaths in Mexico City, where 38 buildings collapsed during the temblor.\r\nThe rest of the casualties came in five states near the capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/12bb9598e86fa6b536555133f459a7c3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
