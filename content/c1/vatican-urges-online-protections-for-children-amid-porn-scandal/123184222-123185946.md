    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) The Vatican secretary of state is urging law enforcement agencies, governments and social media sites to take responsibility to protect children from online sexual abuse and exploitation, even as one of his diplomats is caught up in an international child porn investigation.\r\nCardinal Pietro Parolin made the appeal on Tuesday at the opening of a Catholic Church-sponsored conference on protecting children from predators in cyberspace.\r\nFather Hans Zollner, President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Pontifical Gregorian University, opened the conference with a list of abuses inflicted on children using digital media and demanded that \"we stop these terror attacks on the hearts of children.\"\r\nParticipants offered sobering statistics about the problem. \r\nLast year, Interpol identified five child victims of online abuse every day. \r\nAlso last year, the Internet Watch Foundation identified more than 57,000 websites containing child sexual abuse images.\r\nThe conference is addressing both the harm done to children who are abused and the effects on children's development from being exposed to online pornography.\r\nThe conference came just weeks after Parolin recalled a diplomat from the Vatican's embassy in Washington. \r\nCanadian police have issued an arrest warrant accusing Monsignor Carlo Capella of accessing, possessing and distributing child pornography during a visit to an Ontario church over Christmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/23313fdfc9643f61a08b56536144c5ab \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
