    "description": "(22 Sep 2017) Martin Schulz, leader and of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) and top challenger of German chancellor Angela Merkel, on Friday asked people for their trust and support at his final campaign rally in central Berlin.\r\nSchulz also said that if members of the nationalist Alternative for Germany, or AfD, will gain enough votes to enter parliament on Sunday, \"then the language of the gravediggers of democracy will enter the parliament again for the first time since 1945.\"\r\nPre-election polls give Merkel's conservative Union bloc a lead of 13 to 17 points over the center-left Social Democrats. \r\nThe two are traditional rivals but have governed together in a \"grand coalition\" of the biggest parties for the past four years.\r\nSchulz says he still hopes to win over undecided voters, arguing that Merkel has no vision for the future.\r\nSchulz returned to German politics in January after years as the European Parliament's president. \r\nHe has struggled to gain traction with a campaign that centered on righting perceived economic injustices for Germany's have-nots. \r\nIt's also been difficult for him to carve out clear differences with the conservatives.\r\nPolls show four parties competing for third place, with support between 7 and 12 percent: the Free Democrats, who look set to return to parliament after a four-year absence; the Greens, the Left Party and the AfD.\r\nAfD has swung right since it narrowly missed entering parliament in 2013. \r\nThe AfD has been helped by shrill opposition to Merkel's decision to allow in large numbers of refugees and other migrants in 2015.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5fc70bef802c66883c67a14f93ed2432 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
