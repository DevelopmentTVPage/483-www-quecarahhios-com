    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) Two of Venezuela's leading opposition figures were taken from their homes in the middle of the night by state security agents on Tuesday, in President Nicolas Maduro's first moves against prominent enemies since a widely denounced vote giving his government nearly unlimited powers.\r\nLopez's wife posted what appeared to be video of him being taken from their home after midnight.\r\nAllies of Ledezma posted video of a man who appeared to be the opposition leader being taken by state security as a woman screams for help from neighbours.\r\nLopez was detained three years ago after protests against Maduro's government and sentenced to more than a decade in prison on charges that include inciting protesters to violence. \r\nHe was released last month to serve the rest of his term under house arrest. \r\nLedezma, a former Caracas mayor, was also detained in 2015 and has been under house arrest.\r\nBoth have recently posted videos online denouncing Maduro's decision to hold a vote for a constitutional assembly with the power to overhaul Venezuela's political system.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8e0ab128a12c7f612dab1e2bad337573 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
