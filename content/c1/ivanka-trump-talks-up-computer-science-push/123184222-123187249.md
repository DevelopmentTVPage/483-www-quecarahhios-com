    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) Presidential adviser Ivanka Trump visited Detroit on Tuesday to spread the word about a White House push to prioritize science and technology education.\r\nTrump, the president's daughter and a White House adviser, took part in a panel discussion with business leaders a day after President Donald Trump announced a plan to spend at least $200 million annually on competitive grants so schools can broaden access to computer science education.\r\n\"Knowing how to code is really foundational toward success in any industry, not just tech narrowly defined,\" she said.\r\nJust before Ivanka Trump arrived on stage, the Internet Association announced a commitment of more than $300 million dedicated to K-12 computer science programs.\r\nThe private-sector contribution will be funded by Internet Association member companies and other businesses and individuals over five years. \r\nAmazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce.org each are giving $50 million, Lockheed Martin is promising $25 million and General Motors has pledged $10 million toward the effort. \r\nAdditionally, Detroit-based Quicken Loans announced that it will work to make sure that 15,000 Detroit Public Schools students receive computer science training.\r\nDuring the event at a downtown Detroit high-rise, Ivanka Trump said it is vital that students, especially girls and racial minorities, learn how to write computer code and study computer science. \r\n\"We have to do better, we are going to do better, and this is a giant leap forward in that direction,\" Trump said during the panel discussion, which also included Dan Gilbert, chairman of Quicken Loans; Hadi Partovi, CEO of Code.org; Rob Acker, CEO of Salesforce.org; and Marillyn Hewson, CEO of Lockheed Martin.\r\nGilbert said teaching schoolchildren computer science \"isn't one of these things where maybe this will work. \r\n\"This is the answer. This is flat-out the answer,\" said Gilbert, who also owns the Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9106549e38099c40af08ae575c8b5fc8 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
