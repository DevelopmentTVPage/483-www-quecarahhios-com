    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) Democratic US Senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut, who favors gun control, said on Tuesday that \"the epidemic of gun violence is a uniquely American problem.\" \r\nHe spoke at a news conference on Capitol Hill with other Democratic Senators, urging Congress to take action on gun control, saying \"enough is enough.\" \r\n\"It doesn't happen in any other industrialized country,\" Sen. Murphy said, \"and It's because this country has the loosest set of gun laws allowing dangerous people to own dangerous weapons in the industrialized world.\"\r\nBut even as Democratic leaders pressed for action, none was expected, as other mass shootings in Colorado, Connecticut, and Florida, and even attacks on former congresswoman Gabrielle Gifford and congressman Steve Scalise, failed to unite Congress on any legislative response.\r\nA bipartisan bill on background checks failed in the Senate four years ago, and since then Republicans have usually pointed to mental health legislation when questioned about the appropriate congressional response to gun violence.\r\nThat 2013 legislation was proposed by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. When asked about his stance on gun control on Tuesday, he offered a meek response, saying \"the president could really take a lead on this,\" but in terms of action, he cautioned \"we don't know until we talk to the people that were involved - the first responders in Las Vegas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/0f5cd8cf52743a65b4520224163e79b6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
