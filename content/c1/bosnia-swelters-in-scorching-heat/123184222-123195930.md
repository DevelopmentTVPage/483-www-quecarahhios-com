    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Scorching heat continued to sweep parts of the Balkans, with some parts of Bosnia recording temperatures of over 42 degrees Celsius (107.6 Fahrenheit).\r\nIn the capital of Sarajevo, a young man died of a heart attack while jogging during the warmest time of the day.\r\nUnion leaders in Bosnia have called upon all employers to reduce working hours over the next few days, especially for construction workers and those who work mainly outside. \r\nMeanwhile, a hospital in Zenica closed several of its wards as air conditioning wasn't able to cool off rooms during daytime heat.\r\nThe soaring temperatures were expected to continue until mid August.\r\nThe elderly and those with chronic heart conditions are being advised to stay indoors during the warmest period of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/b2c3a08a0019f68747350b15346ae6bf \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
