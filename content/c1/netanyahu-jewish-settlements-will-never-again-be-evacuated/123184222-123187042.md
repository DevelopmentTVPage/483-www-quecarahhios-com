    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Jewish settlements will never again be evacuated, dealing another blow to a fledgling U.S. attempt to revive the moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process.\r\nSpeaking at a ceremony marking 50 years since Israel captured the West Bank and other territories in the 1967 Mideast war, Netanyahu said Israel had received \"terror and rockets\" when it last withdrew from settlements, referring to Israel's disengagement from Gaza in 2005.\r\n\"There will be no more uprooting of settlements in the land of Israel,\" he said at the ceremony, held in a settlement in the West Bank, south of Jerusalem. \r\n\"It's not the way to make peace.\"\r\nThe Palestinians view Israel's West Bank settlements as illegal and an obstacle to forging peace with the Palestinians. \r\nIsrael disputes this, saying the fate of the settlements must be resolved through negotiations with the Palestinians.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4cd93a9de8eb4b77266476b4959619f9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
