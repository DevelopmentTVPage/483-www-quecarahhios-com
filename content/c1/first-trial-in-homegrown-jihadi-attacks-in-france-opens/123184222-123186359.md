    "description": "(2 Oct 2017) The older brother of a French extremist who killed seven people in a series of attacks on a Jewish school and soldiers goes on trial Monday for complicity in the 2012 shooting spree that in retrospect marked the start of an era of homegrown jihadi violence in France.\r\nThe criminal trial of Abdelkader Merah will be the first time a French court considers charges in the attacks that took the lives of three Jewish children, a teacher and three paratroopers, over nine days in the Toulouse region.\r\nThe 23-year-old gunman, Mohammed Merah, died after a 32-hour televised stand-off with France's police special forces. \r\nAbdelkader Merah has been in custody since days after the Toulouse killings. He has denied helping his brother, who trained with al-Qaida-linked extremists in Pakistan, to prepare for or perpetuate the deadly rampage.\r\nThe trial is being held in a special Paris criminal court and heard by judges. \r\nIt's expected to last one month with about 50 witnesses and a dozen experts called to the stand. \r\nA verdict is expected in early November.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a25cee855050b42020fdd56a848b34df \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
