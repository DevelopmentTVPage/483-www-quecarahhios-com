    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) Aid shipments were beginning to increase into Puerto Rico, according to Governor Ricardo Rossello, with more ports and airports able to handle cargo ships and air traffic.\r\nThe governor toured a fuel facility near San Juan's port, where national guard and private tanker trucks were filling up with badly needed fuel to distribute throughout the island.\r\nRossello said a FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) waiver for matching funds from Puerto Rico, announced on Tuesday, would give the island's government more resources to tackle the many issues facing the recovery effort.\r\nThe waiver means the federal government will assume 100 per cent of the recovery costs, providing relief to the island's cash-strapped government and making it easier to buy needed supplies and hire contractors to fix the electrical grid and other damaged infrastructure.\r\nRossello also said he was \"confident\" the (US) president and the administration understood the nature of the crisis on the island, and were taking the necessary steps to address it.\r\nThe island is facing months of recovery and potentially billions of dollars in costs to restore infrastructure and services.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/7bc0f94e60e107ed6296b7b2ea30ec9b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
