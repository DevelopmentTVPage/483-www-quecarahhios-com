    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) LEADIN:\r\nFollowing years of closure, the University of Benghazi in Libya has once more opened its doors.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nThe University of Benghazi has been badly affected by the ongoing instability in Libya.\r\nWhat once were proud and beautiful buildings are damaged, possibly beyond repair.\r\nConflict raged in the city in 2014 between the Libyan national army and armed groups. The fighting took a heavy toll on the university, forcing students to relocate to other buildings in the city.\r\nThe University of Benghazi is one of the largest integrated universities in Libya.  It was founded in 1955 and contains more than 20 faculties.\r\nMore than 20-thousand students are enrolled at the university.\r\nNow the university has opened its doors again and the students are flooding back.\r\nSome of the faculties such as Law and Economics have been cleaned up and are ready to allow students back in.\r\nLaw student Fatima Al-Shobaki says she is delighted that faculty is open again. \r\nThe Dean of the Faculty of Law, Mustafa Jamali, says a lot of work has gone into getting the building ready for students.\r\n\"The college students have made an extraordinary effort to contribute to the maintenance and cleaning of the college. They have given important and fundamental support and helped raise our morale for the return (of students),\" he says.\r\nBut some other departments, such as Engineering, are still being tidied up.\r\nMany students have volunteered to help get this done.\r\nEngineering student Adnan Bouhdma says they are slowly tidying up many of the buildings at the university.\r\nHe says there are many people getting involved with the clean up.\r\n\"So we contacted our colleagues and there were not many at first, but thank God, now it has increased as you see. There are other colleagues who are cleaning the other side over there,\" he says.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/81813ee1f9fbb411f7f2afcd4b069888 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
