    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) A group of 63 Spanish prisoners were transported to Lima airport on Thursday for a flight back home - the second largest repatriation of Spanish inmates serving prison sentences abroad in the European nation's history.\r\nThe first group of Spanish inmates serving prison sentences in Peru were flown to Spain in March of this year and since then,150, which includes Thursday's group, have been flown back.\r\nOnce in Spain, the prisoners will serve out the rest of their time in Spanish facilities in accordance with a bilateral agreement between Peru and Spain. \r\nPeru is the world's second-largest cocaine producer, with much of the narcotic arriving in Europe through Spain, where traffickers look for recruits in nightclubs, offering a hefty sum to travel to Lima and bring back cocaine.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/42503569d82dc388113b446218f7c3b8 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
