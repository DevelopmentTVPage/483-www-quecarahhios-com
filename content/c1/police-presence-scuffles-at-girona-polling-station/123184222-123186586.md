    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) Catalans were defying police orders to leave designated polling stations Sunday ahead of a banned referendum on the region's secession that has challenged Spain's political and institutional order.\r\nThe country's Constitutional Court has suspended the vote and the Spanish central government says it's illegal. \r\nRegional separatist leaders have pledged to hold it anyway and have called on 5.3 million eligible voters to cast ballots.\r\nDefiant crowds gathered before dawn Sunday in Barcelona and towns across Catalonia at schools and some of the other 2,315 facilities designated as polling stations. \r\nThey were joining parents, children and activists who occupied the buildings over the weekend to make sure that polls open at 9 am (0700 GMT) on Sunday.\r\nIt was unclear how many of the polling stations would be able to open, if any at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/36749a7e48afce35bad45e41e80d7da0 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
