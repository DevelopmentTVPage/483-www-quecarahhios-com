    "description": "(24 Sep 2017) Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) has displayed the country's sophisticated Russian-made S-300 air defense system in central Tehran.\r\nThis is the first time that the S-300 air defense system has been displayed in public.\r\nThe public show in Tehran's Baharestan square near the Parliament building square exhibited different missile systems, including ballistic missiles, solid-fuel surface-to-surface Sejjil missiles and the liquid-fuel Ghadr.\r\nThe IRGC prepared the show for the annual Defense Week, marking the 37th anniversary of the 1980s Iran-Iraq war. \r\nU.S. President Donald Trump signed in August a bill imposing mandatory penalties on those involved in Iran's controversial ballistic missile programme and anyone who does business with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a987eefe1a668a663a93d6210c5ebcfe \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
