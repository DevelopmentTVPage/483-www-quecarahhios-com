    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday that the attack on Kabul international airport by the Taliban was a sign of weakness on the part of the attackers. \r\nStoltenberg said that to attack a civilian airport was a \"criminal act\" and showed the importance of fighting the organisation. \r\nAfghan officials said one woman was killed and 11 other civilians were wounded when Taliban rockets hit Kabul airport earlier on Wednesday.\r\nThe insurgents have said they targeted the plane of visiting US Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis in the attack. \r\nMattis and Stoltenberg were not at the airport at the time of attack, but were meeting Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.\r\nStoltenberg emphasised the importance of the fight against extremists in Afghanistan to prevent them from taking the violence to the rest of the world.\r\nHe also said that the fight against the Islamic State group was a global fight and all the nations around the world must stand united against it.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3e3ea6d33395e3375657908d03ef9691 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
