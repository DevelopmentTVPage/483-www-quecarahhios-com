Thanks to this we understand the value of the relationship between us and we hope to keep the same positive spirit,\" he says.\r\nThe Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry says the two countries must resolve issues using political means.\r\n\"Regarding the regional challenges we are both facing directly and are affected by equally, we both agreed that all that the Arab region is facing has to be solved with a political solution in order to end the destruction and loses that we have been witnessing for the last seven years. And this will be the first step in getting back stability and security and to save our people from terrorism,\" he says.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a272ff5daef66c3a7f0bf99fed8eeffa \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
