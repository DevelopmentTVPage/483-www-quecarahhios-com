    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos said Thursday that his government will not recognise Venezuela's new constitutional assembly to rewrite the struggling nation's constitution.\r\nThe body is empowered to rewrite Venezuela's constitution and Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro vows he will use it to target his opponents and solidify the socialist system installed by the late President Hugo Chavez. \r\nMaduro called the vote in May after weeks of protests fueled by widespread anger over food shortages, triple-digit inflation and high crime \u2014 unrest that continues and has caused at least 125 deaths.\r\nIn addition, during his news conference, Santos recognised that although Colombia remains the world's top exporter of cocaine, he said that staunching the flow is a co-responsibility shared with the United States.\r\n\"If there were no consumption there (US) then there would be no production here,\" he stated.\r\nA 2017 United Nations report shows that coca production in Colombia has surged with potential cocaine production rising 34 percent to around 866 metric tons.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/631fc23cac32d85349392f8e7cc6e5f9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
