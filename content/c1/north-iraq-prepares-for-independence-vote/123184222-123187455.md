    "description": "(24 Sep 2017) Iraq's Kurds were preparing on Sunday to vote in a referendum to decide whether they should secede from Iraq.\r\nIrbil, the capital of the Kurdish region of Iraq, has been decorated with Kurdish flags and residents are preparing to have their say.\r\nThe vote, which is due to go ahead on Monday, has stirred passions in the semi-autonomous region which has long had a troubled relationship with the central government.\r\nNo polls have been published but the referendum result is expected to be overwhelmingly in favour of independence.\r\nThe referendum has been dismissed by Baghdad as destabilising and illegal.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9903d4c7d2dda7f698e80f6a9c328f79 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
