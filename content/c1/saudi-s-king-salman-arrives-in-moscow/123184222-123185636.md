    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) LEADIN:\r\nSaudi King Salman has arrived in Moscow. The first-ever visit by a Saudi monarch to Russia.\r\nSTORYLINE:  \r\nAn honour guard stands ready as the Saudi jet taxis on the runway. \r\nInside is Saudi Arabia's King Salman, and when he steps out it will be a first. \r\nNo Saudi monarch has ever visited Russia before. \r\nAs part of the four-day trip that began Wednesday, the king is to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin for talks expected to focus on the global oil market and the Syrian crisis.\r\nTies between the two countries have often been strained in the past. \r\nThe war in Syria, in which Russia has staunchly backed Syrian President Bashar Assad while Saudi Arabia has supported his foes, has fuelled tensions.\r\nRelations have begun to improve in recent years. \r\nA thaw between Moscow and Riyadh helped reach November's deal in which OPEC and 10 other oil-producing countries, including Russia, agreed to cut their production in a bid to combat a supply glut.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5b371eb97be71a7ae4b12e161208b49c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
