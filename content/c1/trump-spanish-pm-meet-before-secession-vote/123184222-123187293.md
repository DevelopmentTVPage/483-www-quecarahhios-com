    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) President Donald Trump is welcoming Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to the White House days before a crucial secession vote in his country.\r\nThe regional government in Catalonia is holding a binding referendum Sunday on separating from Spain. But the Spanish government insists such a vote is illegal and promises it won't take place. Catalonia is one of Spain's 17 autonomous regions. Its capital is the Mediterranean port city of Barcelona, a favorite for tourists.\r\nState Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert recently said the U.S. has no position on the referendum.\r\nShe says the U.S. will work with any government or entity that comes out of the vote.\r\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday she had nothing to add to the State Department's position on the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/d94920a122356a90eee936be634ac26d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
