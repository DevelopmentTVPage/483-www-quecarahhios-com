    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) Tiffany Huizar, 18, a high school student who lives in Santa Ana, California, was at the concert with her older sister Brianna as a late birthday present. She was hit in the stomach and elbow with bullets and is recovering at University Medical Center.  \r\nOn Wednesday, she got a visit from President Donald Trump, whom she called \"super nice\" and \"comforting.\" \r\nShe sat in a hospital gown holding a big teddy bear, her purple concert wristband still on, next to her patient bracelet.\r\n\"He was super nice,\" Huizar continued. \"He wasn't who we see on social media,\" she then added. \r\nTrump and First Lady Melania met with several other victims and visited first responders during the daylong trip to Las Vegas.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/d1ec5e2ee13d0e9d4700236b903b92ba \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
