    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) ALESSANDRO DELL'ACQUA NODS TO ROCHAS' PAST WHILE DESIGNING WITH AN EYE FOR MODERN\r\nThe glamour of silk and ruffles, sequins and brocade were on display at the Rochas Spring-Summer 2018 show Wednesday  (27SEPT2017) evening at the Pavillon Ledoyen, steps from the Champs-Elys\u00e9es.\r\nThe show, all skirts and dresses, combined Rochas' long heritage (the house dates from 1925) with modernity, Western tradition with Orientalism. \r\nVolume was key, featuring big ruffles that moved to different parts of the body, from high on the back to low on the waist. Fabrics were also important and \"super rich,\" in the words of designer Alessandro Dell'Acqua. \r\nThere were brocades, jacquards, thick embroidery of sequins, Oriental flowers, silvers, royal purple silks and even a jacquard from an old Japanese kimono. Some were reversible, so that two apparently completely different dresses were actually made of the same material, inside out.\r\n\"I looked a lot at the old Rochas,\" said Dell'Acqua after the show, \"but I wanted a new modernity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a091743c79fdf4f66c44632d6967167a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
