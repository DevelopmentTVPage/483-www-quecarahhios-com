    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) Neymar's first press conference with Paris Saint-Germain started in a room packed with reporters, photographers and TV crews.\r\nThe 25-year-old Brazilian was speaking at the Parc des Princes Stadium on Friday - a day after his 222 million-euro (262 million-US dollar) buy-out clause from Barcelona was activated.\r\nPSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi readily dismissed concerns about the club being in breach of football's financial regulations.\r\n\"Please, go and have coffee and don't worry about us - we are in good hands\" said Al-Khelaifi.\r\nNeymar felt that the huge transfer fee would not put extra pressure on him.\r\n\"I am happy - that is the most important thing. It is not a burden.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/00882d22bdda3a22ae43b7efb907315e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
