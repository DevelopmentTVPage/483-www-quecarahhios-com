    "description": "(24 Jul 2017) Fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces advanced towards the western front of the Islamic State group's self-proclaimed capital overnight on Saturday.\r\nThe battle for Raqqa is one fought at night time, with the darkness providing cover from IS snipers. \r\nUS-backed Syrian forces have been battling IS militants in their self-proclaimed capital since the beginning of June. \r\nThe SDF consists of a mix of Kurdish and Arab groups, including the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) and the Shingal Combat Units (YBS), an Iraqi Yazidi group.\r\nThe YBS is deployed to spearhead the forces' advance, complete with a special team of engineers. \r\nTheir primary mission is to clear the route of mines and booby-traps in the streets, as well as to remove any obstacles.\r\nMost of the fighters - some very young - have had relatives either killed or displaced under IS rule. \r\nSeveral weeks ago, the SDF made a swift and surprising advance, breaking through the historic wall that surrounds the old centre of Raqqa. \r\nSince then, the advance has been at a crawl, a few hundred meters at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/256e68cae12c6a7325f3ad3ae6facca2 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
