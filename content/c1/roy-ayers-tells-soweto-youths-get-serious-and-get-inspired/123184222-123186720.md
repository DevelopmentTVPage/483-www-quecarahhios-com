    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) ROY AYERS TELLS SOWETO YOUTHS: GET SERIOUS AND GET INSPIRED\r\nJazz musician Roy Ayers offered some rhythmic advice for youths in Johannesburg's Soweto area Friday (29 SEPT. 2017): Get serious, be inspired, rap on, keep on and \"eventually you'll get it.\"\r\nAyers, who is in South Africa for a music festival, radiated enthusiasm while urging a couple of dozen people at an arts center to \"vibe on\" role models even if they don't always meet expectations. \r\nHis audience responded with nods and applause, and the composer of the 1976 hit \"Everybody Loves the Sunshine\" had his chance to clap when performers took the microphone to sing, rap, play drums and recite poetry.\r\n\"You guys, you have to pick your plateau. Get serious about everything,\" said Ayers, a Los Angeles-born vocalist and vibraphone player who has delved into a range of musical genres, including funk and rhythm and blues.\r\nAyers, who turned 77 this month, performed at the Standard Bank Joy of Jazz festival in Johannesburg that ends Saturday.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/097556acdc8d76289b443dccf9c838af \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
