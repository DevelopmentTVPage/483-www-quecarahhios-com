    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Rome's heat wave is gripping the city with temperatures hitting 41- 42 degrees Celsius (106 - 108 Fahrenheit) and, according to Italy's Ministry of Health, some 16 other Italian cities are nearing 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). \r\nTourists, however, were defiant and continued to visit the city, combating the high temperatures with the help of ice-cream, cool drinks and fresh fruit, claiming the beauty of Rome was enough to make them forget about the weather.\r\nSeveral restaurants were offering air-conditioning and water-spray fans in esplanades outside.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/d8ad7b3006e7613df6408f42eb820371 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
