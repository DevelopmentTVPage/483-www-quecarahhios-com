    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Former White House chief ethics attorney Richard Painter blasted the Trump administration on spending taxpayers' money by asking, \"are these officials there to protect the American people, to protect the taxpayer, or are they there to protect special interests?\"\r\n\"This is something taxpayers should worry about,\" said Painter, who served under President George W. Bush.\r\nPainter criticized Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, who resigned as a firestorm unfolded about his use of private aircraft to attend events outside of Washington. He also criticized other top officials in the Trump administration, even the president, for misspending taxpayers' funds.\r\n\"Of course, we've got the president himself, who wants to hop on down to Mar-a-Lago every other weekend in the wintertime, and those trips can cost about a million a 'pop,' depending on how many people they want to bring down with him on Air Force One. So, we certainly don't have a good ethos in this administration with respect to the use of taxpayer money.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cfc589b1c1bbb57a4c95461e9214fff9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
