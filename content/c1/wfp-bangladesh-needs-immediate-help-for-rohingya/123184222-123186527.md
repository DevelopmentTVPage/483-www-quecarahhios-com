    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) The head of the United Nations World Food Programme on Sunday urged the international community to step up its support for the relief operation for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh or risk \"a catastrophic humanitarian disaster\".\r\nMore than half a million Rohingya Muslims have fled into the country in little more than a month to escape a Myanmar military operation so brutal it has been condemned as ethnic cleansing. \r\nThe crackdown was in response to a series of deadly attacks on security posts by Muslim insurgents.\r\nAuthorities have housed the refugees in a number of existing camps near the border but the huge numbers and the sheer speed of the exodus have created acute needs, including food.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/62c934d3c5431588c2a43c6213057291 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
