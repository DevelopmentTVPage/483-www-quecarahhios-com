    "description": "(22 Sep 2017) CATE BLANCHETT AND LEWIS HAMILTON AMONG STARS AT ARMANI MILAN SHOW\r\nWhen the times go dark, Giorgio Armani goes bright.\r\nThe 83-year-old designer's Armani collection for next spring and summer, which showed in Milan Friday (22 SEPT. 2017), bursts with florals and color, often on a background of black. The silhouette is loose and feminine, with short skirts featuring leg-revealing tulip hemlines, sheer organza pantsuits with an easy cut and casual apron dress with abstract florals.\r\nThe designer often layered florals and prints over dark underlays - perhaps a message to see the brighter side of things. At other times he placed a sheer layer over prints, creating a smoky effect. Silken printed skirts opened over a black dress, or a long, draping foulard tucked across the front of a cocktail dress. The prints were inspired by painters, the designer won't say whom.\r\nThe primary color combinations for daywear are red and purple with black accents, segueing into grays for formal suits and black for evening.\r\nDespite the designer's intentions, long black veils over cocktail dresses had a funereal feel, and somehow the pompoms bouncing on scarves and bedecking caps failed to provide levity. The prevalent bangle shape: Teardrops.\r\nCelebrities at the show included Cate Blanchett, Amber Valletta, Lewis Hamilton and Princess Charlene of Monaco.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/34874c0600ef6e0e510ff75c182d53a1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
