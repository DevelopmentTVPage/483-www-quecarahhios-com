    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) British novelist Kazuo Ishiguro said it was \"genuinely a surprise\" to hear he had won the Nobel Prize for literature.\r\nSpeaking on Thursday after the announcement of the prize, Japanese-born Ishiguro, told reporters he hoped that literature could help during, what he called, uncertain times in today's society.\r\nIshiguro's most well-known novel is \"The Remains of the Day,\" which was turned into a popular movie of the same title. \r\nHis most recent novel is 2015's \"The Buried Giant,\" about an elderly couple's trip through an English landscape to meet a son they haven't seen in years.\r\nThe choice of British novelist Ishiguro marks a return to conventional literature after two consecutive years in which the prize went to non-traditional recipients - singer-songwriter Bob Dylan and Belarusian journalist, Svetlana Alexievich.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/d56e2fb8733ed940c91c1db8ba947091 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
