    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) KAZUO ISHIGURO COMMENTS ON HIS NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITERATURE\r\nBritish novelist Kazuo Ishiguro said it was \"amazing\" and \"unexpected\" to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.\r\nSpeaking on Thursday (5 OCT. 2017) after being awarded the prize, Japanese-born Ishiguro, 62, told reporters he hopes his win will encourage the forces for goodwill and peace.\r\nIshiguro's most well-known novel is \"The Remains of the Day,\" which was turned into a popular movie of the same title. \r\nHis most recent novel is 2015's \"The Buried Giant,\" about an elderly couple's trip through an English landscape to meet a son they haven't seen in years.\r\nThe choice of British novelist Ishiguro marks a return to conventional literature after two consecutive years in which the prize went to non-traditional recipients - singer-songwriter Bob Dylan and Belarusian journalist Svetlana Alexievich.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a1e466adbf4074f02593cb87c04e0899 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
