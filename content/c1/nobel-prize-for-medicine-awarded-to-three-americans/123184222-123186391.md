    "description": "(2 Oct 2017) The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to three Americans on Monday for discoveries about the body's daily rhythms.\r\nThe laureates are Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W. Young. \r\nRosbash is on the faculty at Brandeis University, Young at Rockefeller University and Hall has been associated with the University of Maine.\r\nThe citation for the 9-million-kronor (1.1 million US dollar) prize says the researchers isolated a gene that controls the normal daily biological rhythm. \r\nThey \"were able to peek inside our biological clock and elucidate its inner workings\".\r\nCircadian rhythms adapt the workings of the body to different phases of the day, influencing sleep, behavior, hormone levels, body temperature and metabolism.\r\nThe winners have raised \"awareness of the importance of a proper sleep hygiene\", said Juleen Zierath of the Nobel academy.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3d53b52287e277690dba858109d6de4e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
