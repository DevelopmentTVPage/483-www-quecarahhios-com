    "description": "(2 Oct 2017) The Nobel Prize for Medicine has been awarded to three Americans for discoveries about the body's daily rhythms.\r\nThe laureates are Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young.\r\nRobash is on the faculty at Brandeis University, Young at Rockefeller University, while Hall did his work at Brandeis and is now retired and lives in Cambridge in Boston.\r\nThe citation for the nine-million-kronor (1.1 million US dollars) prize says the researchers isolated a gene that controls the normal daily biological rhythm. They \"were able to peek inside our biological clock and elucidate its inner workings.\"\r\nCircadian rhythms adapt one's physiology to different phases of the day, influencing sleep, behaviour, hormone levels, body temperature and metabolism.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6fecb7bbd21f45a10ea39ca2771f59e0 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
