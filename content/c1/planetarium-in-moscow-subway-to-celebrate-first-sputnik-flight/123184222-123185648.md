    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) A mobile planetarium has been installed at one of Moscow's metro stations to celebrate the anniversary of the first Sputnik flight. \r\nThe installation was designed to be focussed on children, but commuters of all ages can visit the planetarium to enjoy a space show and learn about modern space studies.\r\nThe 1957 launch of Sputnik - the world's first artificial satellite - ushered in the space era and showcased the Soviet Union's military might and technological prowess.\r\nScientist Sergey Korolyov ordered his team of engineers to design a primitive orbiter to save time and beat the US into space. \r\nThe craft, which was built in only a few months, was named PS-1 for \"Prosteishiy Sputnik\" - or the \"Simplest Satellite.\"\r\nThe satellite, weighing less than 84 kilograms (about 184 pounds) and slightly larger than a basketball, was a pressurised sphere of polished aluminum alloy with two radio transmitters and four antennas.\r\nSputnik contained a radio transmitter, broadcasting a distinctive \"beep-beep-beep\" sound. \r\nIt orbited the Earth for three months before burning up in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ff6019e034616de752ce3726e2443a47 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
