    "description": "(2 Oct 2017) The mother of the older brother of a French extremist who killed seven people in a series of attacks on a Jewish school and soldiers said he was being unfairly targeted as his trial for complicity in the 2012 shooting spree opened on Monday.\r\nZoulikha Aziri said seeing Abdelkader Merah on trial \"hurts because my son is innocent, he had nothing to do with that.\"\r\nMonday's criminal trial of 35-year-old Abdelkader Merah will be the first time a French court considers charges in the attacks that took the lives of three Jewish children, a teacher and three paratroopers, over nine days in the Toulouse region.\r\nThe gunman, 23-year-old Mohammed Merah, died after a 32-hour televised standoff with France's police special forces. Abdelkader Merah has denied helping his brother prepare for or perpetuate his deadly rampage.\r\nHis defence lawyer says the older Merah was charged with complicity to terror and sent to trial \"by default\" because the actual killer was dead.\r\nAbdelkader Merah faces up to life in prison if convicted. He denies wrongdoing.\r\nA verdict is expected in early November.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1aa30e4a91afa2ed5eb2d9dbc9acabf3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
