    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) President Donald Trump is sending \"America's hearts and prayers\" to people in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and says he'll visit both places next week.\r\nTrump said Tuesday that a \"massive\" effort to help people recover from Hurricane Maria is underway. He added that includes the military, though he did not give specifics.\r\nTrump spoke in the White House Rose Garden after he received criticism from some U.S. lawmakers that the administration's response to Hurricane Maria has fallen short of its efforts in Texas and Florida after storms there.\r\nMaria roared ashore Sept. 20 and knocked out nearly all power in Puerto Rico, leaving its 3.4 million residents short of food, water and supplies.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5f3b6b65ac5ac954508e2f31dd932255 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
