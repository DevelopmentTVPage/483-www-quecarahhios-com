    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) Lawmakers for the nationalist, anti-migrant Alternative for Germany, or AfD, who have entered parliament for the first time, met in Berlin on Tuesday.\r\nGerman parties' newly elected parliamentary groups are holding their first meetings after an election that left Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc weakened, but still on top.\r\nIt now faces a complicated task of forming a coalition government and the prospect of robust opposition from both the right and left.\r\nThe most politically plausible option for the next government led by Merkel is a three-way coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats and the traditionally left-leaning Greens.\r\nMerkel has said she wants to seek talks with them, but also with her former coalition partner, the Social Democrats who say they will go into opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/102a648f0e6ab7d0e274015471ca477a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
