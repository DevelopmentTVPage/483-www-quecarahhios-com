    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) Dussehra, the Hindu festival symbolising the victory of good over evil, was celebrated across India on Saturday.\r\nThe festival celebrates the defeat of mythological demon Ravana at the hands of the Hindu deity Lord Rama by burning huge effigies of Ravana, his son Meghnad and brother Kumbhkarna.\r\nAt New Delhi's Ramlila ground, actors dressed as Rama, his wife Sita and brother Lakshman enacted the final moments of the battle with Ravana, at the end of which the effigies were set ablaze. \r\nThe crowd cheered as the crackers caught fire and the effigies went up in flames.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/16a98452a4ae99cbda2f5bcf204ee1f1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
