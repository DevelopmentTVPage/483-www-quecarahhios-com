    "description": "(24 Sep 2017) Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) top candidate Martin Schulz said on Sunday he was hoping many undecided voters would vote for his party in the country's national election. \r\nSchulz voted in Wuerselen, the city where her served as mayor for more than a decade.\r\nHe is Chancellor Angela Merkel's main challenger.\r\nPollsters said earlier in the week that many voters had remained undecided until the very last moment. \r\nBut Merkel was widely expected to win a fourth term in office as Germans went to the polls on Sunday in an election that is also likely to see the farthest right-wing party in 60 years, the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany, win seats in parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/41d338a76efca50cb5f8667d3f38cd85 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
