    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) Lawmakers for the German Green party met in Berlin on Tuesday. \r\nGerman parties' newly elected parliamentary groups held their first meetings after the election that left Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc weakened, but still on top.\r\nIt now faces a complicated task of forming a coalition government and the prospect of robust opposition from both the right and left.\r\nThe most politically plausible option is a three-way coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats and the traditionally left-leaning Greens.\r\nThe combination, called a \"Jamaica\" coalition because the parties' colors match those of the Caribbean nation's flag, hasn't been tried before in a national government.\r\nMerkel will have to bridge differences between the Free Democrats and Greens.\r\nThe parties have a tradition of mutual suspicion as well as differences on issues including environmental policy, European financial policy and the auto industry's future.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8c93099742a81c825a5a92bcc5d80047 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
