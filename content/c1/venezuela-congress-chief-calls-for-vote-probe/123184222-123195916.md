    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) The president of Venezuela's opposition-controlled National Assembly says the legislature will call for an investigation into claims that the official turnout figure in Sunday's election was inflated by at least 1 million votes. \r\nJulio Borges says findings disclosed Wednesday by voting software company Smartmatic provide \"complete confirmation\" of what opposition leaders and independent analysts had suspected. \r\nThe National Electoral Council reported that more than 8 million Venezuelans cast ballots for delegates to a government-backed, all-powerful assembly with powers to rewrite the constitution and override any other branch of government. \r\nOpposition leaders questioned that figure and at least one exit poll suggested the turnout was less than half that amount. \r\nBorges says lawmakers will ask the nation's chief prosecutor to investigate election board members for potential crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c3a23f14a73e617d0fa9b39e87b8fac1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
