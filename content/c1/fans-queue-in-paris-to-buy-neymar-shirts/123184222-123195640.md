    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) Paris Saint Germain (PSG) fans queued up at the Parc des Princes Stadium on Friday to buy shirts bearing the name of Brazilian striker Neymar.\r\nHundreds of others were doing the same on the Champs-Elysees following the former Barcelona player's world-record transfer.\r\nThe shirts cost 155 euros ($184).\r\nNeymar, the world's most expensive football player, departed the Spanish club earlier on Friday ahead of his unveiling at PSG. \r\nHe joined the French side for 222 million euros (262 million US dollars) on Thursday after the buy-out clause in his contract was activated.\r\nPSG shattered the world transfer record - paying over double the 105 million euros (125 million US dollars) Manchester United paid for French midfielder Paul Pogba - to sign arguably one of the top three best attacking players in the game, alongside Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4f6bca2bcbf37e58482425841f4f9022 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
