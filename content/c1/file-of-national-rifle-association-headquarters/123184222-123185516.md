    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) The National Rifle Association says the \"bump stocks\" device that the Las Vegas shooter used to turn semi-automatic rifles into fully automated weapons should be \"subject to additional regulations.\"\r\nIn a statement on Thursday, the NRA says the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives should immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law.\r\nThe organisation, which holds a powerful sway over members of Congress, dismissed some of the initial responses from lawmakers who have pressed for more gun control.\r\nThe NRA said \"Banning guns from law-abiding Americans based on the criminal act of a madman will do nothing to prevent future attacks.\"\r\nThe statement came from NRA leaders Wayne LaPierre and Chris Cox.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4a8be39ade3608cfae0a0b48cf9204fe \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
