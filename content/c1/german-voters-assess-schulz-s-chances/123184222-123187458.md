    "description": "(24 Sep 2017) German voters on Sunday were casting their ballots in the country's national election in the small town of Wuerselen, where chancellor candidate Martin Schulz was expected to vote later that day. \r\nWuerselen is the city where Schulz served as mayor for more than a decade. \r\nGermany's Social Democrats (SPD) top candidate is Chancellor Angela Merkel main challenger. \r\nMerkel's conservative bloc of the Christian Democratic Party and Bavarian-only Christian Social Union has a healthy lead in the polls.\r\nGerman voters will elect their new parliament on Sunday, but don't expect a new government to be in place next week.\r\nWith the seats expected to be spread across up to six caucuses, there's very little chance of anyone winning a majority to govern alone. \r\nAfter voters have had their say, it's down to Germany's political parties to put together a coalition to govern for the next four years.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c12e64c18155b897fdd72f50c24facb7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
