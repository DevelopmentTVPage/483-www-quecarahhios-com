    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) House Speaker Paul Ryan is facing questions from Republican voters in Wisconsin who say they are frustrated with a lack of action in Congress.\r\nRyan held a town hall meeting Wednesday for employees of a wire manufacturing plant, Banker Wire, in Mukwonago, Wisconsin. It's in his congressional district.\r\nEmployee Keith Ketzler says Republicans promised that they had a plan but \"all I see is in-fighting.\" Ketzler says Congress appears to be \"very dysfunctional.\"\r\nRyan says, \"Believe me, I understand your frustration.\"\r\nRyan says he thought the Senate had the votes last week to pass its health care bill and called its failure \"extremely frustrating.\"\r\nHe also called the deal of Foxconn bringing thousands of jobs to Wisconsin a \"game-changer.\" Ryan said he pitched federal job training benefits and tax credits that make the U.S. competitive to Foxconn officials who were deciding whether to locate in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/45448235c606e4465d9a9dd772dc3dbe \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
