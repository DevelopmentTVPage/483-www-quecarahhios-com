    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) The director of national intelligence is warning about leaks of classified information, saying that anyone who does will be prosecuted to the 'fullest extent of the law'.\r\nDan Coats, the director of national intelligence expressed 'grave concern' over the leak of classified information, and the Trump administration is stepping up efforts to crack down on them.\r\nThe announcement at the Justice Department comes one week after President Donald Trump complained that Sessions was weak in cracking down on leaks and as a White House adviser raised the possibility of lie detector tests for people inside the administration. It also comes amid a series of news reports this year involving the Trump campaign and White House that relied on classified information. \r\nTrump's outbursts against media organizations he derides as \"fake news\" have led to concerns that the administration will more aggressively try to root out leaks following stories that officials see as negative, and the timing of the Sessions announcement _ one week after he was criticized by the president for being weak on \"intel leakers\" _ raised the possibility that he was acting to quell the anger of the man who appointed him. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe director of national intelligence is warning about leaks of classified information, saying that anyone who does will be prosecuted to the 'fullest extent of the law'.\r\nDan Coats, the director of national intelligence expressed 'grave concern' over the leak of classified information, and the Trump administration is stepping up efforts to crack down on them.\r\nThe announcement at the Justice Department comes one week after President Donald Trump complained that Sessions was weak in cracking down on leaks and as a White House adviser raised the possibility of lie detector tests for people inside the administration.
