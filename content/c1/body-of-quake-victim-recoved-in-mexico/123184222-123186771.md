    "description": "(28 Sep 2017) Authorities have elevated the death toll from Mexico's Sept. 19 earthquake to 343, with 204 of the deaths coming in the nation's capital. \r\nOn Thursday, the body of a quake victim was being removed by search and rescue teams at the Avenida Alvaro Obregon building collapse site. \r\nNational Civil Defense chief Luis Felipe Puente announced the new toll Thursday, as recovery teams pulled some of the few remaining bodies out of collapsed buildings in Mexico City. \r\nMost of the capital's collapse sites have already been cleared of rubble. \r\nPresident Enrique Pena Nieto said Wednesday that preliminary accounting suggests damage from the magnitude 7.1 quake and an even more powerful one earlier in the month could cost upward of $2 billion (38.1 billion pesos).\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c1610ca8c26515e19ef18bca90fb732b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
