The president embraced the legislation on Wednesday. \r\nBut during the combative press briefing, Miller clashed with the media over the plan and accused one reporter of being \"cosmopolitan\" when he suggested it would only bring in English-speaking people from Great Britain and Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3dfd85c2f47c41d82e69f4226168908a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
