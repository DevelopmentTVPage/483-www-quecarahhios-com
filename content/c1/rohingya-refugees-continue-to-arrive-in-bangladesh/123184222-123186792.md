    "description": "(28 Sep 2017) The stream of Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar into Bangladesh has continued unabated, with the United Nations saying that the number has now topped 500,000 people since August. \r\nBangladesh and aid agencies operating there are struggling to provide shelter and basic facilities for the Rohingya who are packed into refugee settlements and banned from leaving.\r\nBut the boats keep coming. \r\nAt Shah Porir Dwip, a town at Bangladesh's southern tip, hundreds of Rohingya were seen walking towards Teknaf in search of shelter on Thursday. \r\nRasida Begum, who crossed over to Bangladesh on Wednesday night, said her husband was killed by a mob of Buddhist monks. \r\nShe said she had to give her ear ring to the boat man to pay for the ride to safety. \r\nA mother of two young sons, she could only save one during the perilous journey.\r\nMyanmar's military launched what they called clearance operations after Rohingya insurgents targeted security forces in attacks on 25 August.\r\nThe refugees say Buddhist mobs and Myanmar soldiers set entire villages on fire and shot at villagers indiscriminately.\r\nThe UN human rights chief has called the attacks \"a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"\r\nOn Thursday the UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said that the total number of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh was believed to be well over 700,000 people.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6580992ed4d534204c7410fdfda04785 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
