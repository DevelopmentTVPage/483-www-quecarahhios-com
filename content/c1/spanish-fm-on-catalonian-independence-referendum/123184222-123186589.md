    "description": "(30 Sep 2017) Spain's minister for foreign affairs on Saturday accused the Catalan government of staging a \"mockery of democracy.\" \r\nSpeaking to the Associated Press at the Palacio de Viana in Madrid, Alfonso Dastis accused those who are trying to hold the referendum of \"Nazi behaviour.\"\r\nDastis also accused the Catalan government of trying to promote an exclusionary system that runs counter to the goals and ideals the European Union is trying to advance.\r\nHe said voter referenda can't be equated with democracy and asserted they actually were the \"instrument of choice of dictators.\"\r\nThe Spanish government maintains the referendum is unconstitutional and the country's Constitutional Court suspended the vote so it could consider the matter.\r\nCatalan officials said they plan to hold the referendum anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/204a2c2aa752536b2488cc7e729f4d8a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
