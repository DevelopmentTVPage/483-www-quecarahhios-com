    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) Spanish riot police smashed their way into polling stations to try to halt a disputed independence referendum in Catalonia on Sunday and fired rubber bullets at protesters outside a Barcelona polling station. \r\nSeveral people were injured.\r\nThe officers fired the rubber bullets while trying to clear protesters who were trying to prevent National Police cars from leaving after police confiscated ballot boxes from the voting centre. \r\nThe Spanish government has ordered police to stop the voting process, saying it was illegal.\r\nCatalan officials said 38 people were treated for mostly minor injuries. \r\nAn AP photographer saw several people who had been injured during the scuffles outside Barcelona's Rius i Taule school, where some voters had cast ballots before police arrived\r\nCatalan President Carles Puigdemont condemned the crackdown.\r\nEnric Millo, the Spanish government's representative in the region, said police and National Guard forces acted \"professionally\" to enforce court orders. \r\nHe said any attempt to claim the referendum as valid was doomed.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/bc1d926a427430f235f8af0ba9ab8270 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
