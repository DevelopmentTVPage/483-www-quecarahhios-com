    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) The turnout figures in Venezuela's Constituent Assembly election were \"tampered with\", the director of a company that provides electoral support services to the country said on Tuesday.\r\nSpeaking in London, Antonio Mugica, the CEO and Director of Smartmatic, said the company estimated \"the difference between the actual participation and the one announced by the authorities is at least one million votes\"\r\nSmartmatic was a company created by Venezuelans in Caracas providing electronic voting machines to the late President Hugo Chavez. In recent years it has branched out to provide the same services to countries across the world, while continuing to provide support for elections in Venezuela.\r\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro called the vote for the constitutional assembly in May after weeks of protests fed by anger at his government over food shortages, triple-digit inflation and high crime. \r\nMany people accuse the ruling party of corruption and mismanagement.\r\nTensions have escalated since government-allied electoral authorities said more than eight million people voted on Sunday, a turnout figure that was disputed by the opposition and independent analysts and condemned by many nations in the region and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/b29e66393e262e69a6c87149a9efefcd \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
