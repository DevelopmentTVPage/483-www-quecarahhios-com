    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) A senior Indian official on Friday said the government was prepared to ensure the security of its citizens and territory, as Beijing intensified its warnings to Indian troops to get out of a contested region high in the Himalayas where China, India and Bhutan meet.\r\nExternal Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj told parliament on Thursday that India was concerned about China's actions affecting the tri-junction boundary point, as well as the India-China border.\r\nQuoting Swaraj, her spokesman on Friday said \"war is not an answer\" and that India would continue to engage with China on a diplomatic level.\r\nIndian troops entered the area in the Doklam Plateau in June after New Delhi's ally Bhutan complained a Chinese military construction party was building a road inside Bhutan's territory.\r\nBeijing says Doklam is located in Tibet and that the border dispute between China and Bhutan has nothing to do with India. \r\nIt has demanded that Indian troops withdraw before any talks.\r\nExperts in India say that by building the road, China may be able to gain access to a narrow strip of Indian land known as the Siliguri Corridor or Chicken's Neck. \r\nIf China was able to block the corridor, it would isolate India's northeast from the rest of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8cdac025553dfd1dca615075b2c9f9b3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
