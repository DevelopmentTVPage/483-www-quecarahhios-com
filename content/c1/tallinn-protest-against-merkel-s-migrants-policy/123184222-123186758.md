    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Some 150 protesters from Estonia's nationalist-conservative EKRE party have demonstrated outside a summit of EU leaders in Tallinn against the EU's immigration policies and its refugee quota system.\r\nThey held banners in German and English urging the end to \"multikulti\", short for multi-cultural Europe, a reference often used in Estonia to describe Germany's society.\r\n\"We think that the immigration crisis is largely the fault of Merkel, that what she did was so malignant, so evil against the people of Europe, and she needs to be reminded that her hands are with blood,\" EKRE (Conservative People's Party of Estonia) chairman Martin Helme told The Associated Press. \r\nSo far only some 80-100 refugees have been placed into Estonia under the EU's refugee quota.\r\nBeyond the noise, sometimes drowning out the statements from arriving leaders, no significant incidents were reported.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/49cdc8673de15f491a3d0dc3de2c8e7a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
