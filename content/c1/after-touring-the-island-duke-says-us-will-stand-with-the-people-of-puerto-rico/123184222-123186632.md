    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) US Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, Elaine Duke said Friday that the United States will \"continue to stand with the people of Puerto Rico.\"\r\nDuke spoke after touring the island with the Governor of Puerto Rico.\r\nDuke arrived earlier in the day with a team of experts after having drawn a sharp rebuke from San Juan's Mayor Thursday for saying that the federal relief effort is \"a good news story.\"\r\nPuerto Rico's Governor, Ricardo Rossello said that rebuilding the island's electrical gird would be slow and lengthy process because \"the devastation was severe.\" \r\nThere were signs that the island is slowly emerging from the disaster. \r\nTelecommunications were back for about 30 percent of the island, giving some people the critical ability to call relatives and others for help if needed. \r\nHurricane Maria devastated the US territory of 3.4 million last week, destroying homes and businesses.\r\nIt is blamed for 16 deaths on the island.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3e09e2e47fe6391dbb422461516df444 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
