    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) The United States on Friday abruptly warned Americans not to visit Cuba and ordered more than half its Havana embassy personnel to leave the island in a dramatic response to mysterious recent \"specific attacks\" harming the health of U.S. diplomats.\r\nThe actions deal a blow to already delicate ties between the U.S. and Cuba, longtime adversaries who only recently began putting their hostility behind them. \r\nThe embassy in Havana will lose roughly 60 percent of its U.S. staff, and will stop processing visas in Cuba indefinitely, officials said. \r\nRoughly 50 Americans are currently working at the embassy in Havana.\r\nAssociated Press Foreign Policy reporter Josh Lederman has been following the story.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/db479c57eefb32a3937da8d0a19fd47c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
