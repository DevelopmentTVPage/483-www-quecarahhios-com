    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) Polls for Rwanda's presidential election came to a close on Friday.\r\nThe incumbent president, Paul Kagame, is widely expected to win the vote.\r\nKagame won the 2010 election with 93 percent of the vote and told a rally in July that \"the day of the presidential elections will just be a formality.\"\r\nHe is running against Frank Habineza of the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda - the only permitted opposition party - and independent candidate Philippe Mpayimana.\r\nThere were long lines at polling stations in some parts of the capital, Kigali. \r\nMpayimana and Habineza voted in other locations in the capital.\r\nAt some polling stations, music urged voters to choose the candidate who will transform the country and unite all Rwandans.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/87d610d6502476dd0e64d714465adf5c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
