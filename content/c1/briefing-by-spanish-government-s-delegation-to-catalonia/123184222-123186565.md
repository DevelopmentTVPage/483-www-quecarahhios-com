    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) The highest-ranking Spanish official in the northeastern region on Sunday said that \"the state of law has been reduced to nothing\", reiterating the central government's stance that the referendum on Catalonian independence was \"illegal\". \r\nEnric Millo made the remarks as polling has begun in a banned referendum on Catalonia's independence, with the first voters casting ballots amid cheers in some of the designated polling stations.\r\nMeanwhile, Spanish riot police forcefully removed a few hundred would-be voters from a polling station at Estela school in Barcelona, and smashed their way into a polling station in Sant Julia de Ramis, near the Catalan city of Girona.\r\nSpain's Constitutional Court ordered the vote to be suspended. \r\nRegional separatist leaders have pledged to hold it anyway, promising to declare independence if the \"yes\" side wins, and have called on 5.3 million eligible voters to cast ballots.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9c2aa91514bd6ab242a818ee057822d4 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
