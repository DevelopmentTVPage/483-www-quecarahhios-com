    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday Spain should stay united.\r\nTrump commented shortly before a planned October 1 secession vote called by Spain's regional government in Catalonia.\r\nTrump said at a White House news conference with visiting Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy Spain was \"a great country and it should remain united.\"\r\nRajoy opposes the coming vote, calling it \"crazy\".\r\nHe said such a referendum would be illegal, if held, because there is no electoral committee to supervise the process.\r\nHe said he wanted both sides to \"move on to a new stage where the rule of law, dialogue and common sense will prevail.\"  \r\nCatalonia is one of Spain's 17 autonomous regions. \r\nIts capital is the Mediterranean port city of Barcelona, a favourite of tourists.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ee65ffbb558dc8cdd674e44c6eeda31a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
