    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) Graffiti depicting US President Donald Trump has appeared on Israel's security barrier in the West Bank city of Bethlehem.\r\nOne drawing shows Trump hugging and kissing an Israeli watchtower that makes up part of the wall.\r\nIn another, Trump is depicted wearing a Jewish skullcap. \r\nA cartoon bubble next to him reads \"I'm going to build you a brother.\"\r\nPassers by took an immediate interest in the image as they lined up to take photos by the wall.\r\nThe images carried the signature of an artist going by the alias @Lushsux, but it wasn't immediately clear if the work found early on Friday was done by Banksy or a Banksy-wannabe.\r\nBanksy has made forays into the Palestinian territories in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/e15f8142d6071558151ab81584bddd62 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
