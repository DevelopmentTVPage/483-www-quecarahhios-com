    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) A cricket legend who may be Pakistan's future prime minister said the United States should stop trying to destroy the Taliban and instead talk to them with help from Pakistan.\r\nIn an exclusive interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Imran Khan, considered a likely contender for premier after next year's parliamentary elections, rejected US President Donald Trump's allegation that his country harbours extremists. \r\nHe said Pakistanis felt hurt when Trump blamed Pakistan for sheltering militants while unveiling the US strategy for Afghanistan in August.\r\nHe said that the Taliban have safe havens in Afghanistan and that Pakistan is being subjected the group's attacks launched from Afghan soil.\r\nUS officials have long said that Pakistan turns a blind eye to militants operating along the porous Afghan border.\r\nKhan also said he believes there was no way anyone in the Sharif family \"will ever be able to be in politics\" again.\r\nDocuments leaked from a Panama law firm appeared to show that senior Pakistani officials, including former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, had undisclosed assets.\r\nPakistan's Supreme Court disqualified Sharif in July, forcing him to step down. \r\nSharif, who is due in court Tuesday facing corruption charges, has denied any wrongdoing.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/2855a3f516cd4fe318273c5e8f34de59 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
