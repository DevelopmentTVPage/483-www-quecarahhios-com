    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson addressed reporters Tuesday afternoon in the State Department briefing room.\r\nHe said he was there to give a six month review of the international policy positions of the Donald Trump administration.\r\nTillerson said the US-Russian relationship is under heavy stress and he suggested that the conditions could become worse.\r\nHe also said that Washington does not seek a regime change in North Korea as tensions renewed over the country's nuclear and missile programs.\r\nTillerson reaffirmed Washington's policy on North Korea during a press briefing at the State Department.\r\n\"We are not seeking a regime change ... we do not seek a collapse of the regime,\" he said. \"We do not seek accelerated reunification. We do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th parallel.\"\r\nTillerson's remarks come as tensions run high following North Korea's second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile last week.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9e4550879663c4e5aa0e00fb5495d6f2 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
