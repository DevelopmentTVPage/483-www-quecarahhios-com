    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) The Hungarian government has resumed its campaign against Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist George Soros and his support for migration.\r\nThe \"national consultation\" includes a government survey sent to Hungarian households about a so-called \"Soros Plan\" - which the government says is being carried out by the European Union - as well as billboards and television ads.\r\nGoran Buldioski, director of Soros' Open Society Initiatives in Europe, said Soros and his foundations support \"more coherent and humane policies for helping to resettle migrants fleeing oppression and violence in their homelands\" but that \"there is no such thing as a global conspiracy against Hungary.\"\r\nActivists from the Egyutt (Together) opposition party tore down billboards on Thursday, saying the government was just trying to divert attention from its own shortcomings.\r\nGovernment spokesman Zoltan Kovacs however insisted that \"there is a Soros Plan, a detailed one which is again in our belief is against the interest of Hungary and against the interest of the European Union.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/bbca30fb2ba52e343640753a904981e9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
