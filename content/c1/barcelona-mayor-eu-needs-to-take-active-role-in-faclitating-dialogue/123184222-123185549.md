    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) The mayor of Barcelona has called on the EU to take an active role in facilitating dialogue between the Spanish and Catalan governments.\r\nSpeaking on Thursday, Ada Colau said a \"forum for dialogue\" needed to be formed, but that it was only possible to do so with European involvement.\r\nShe called for European institutions to consider setting up a task force of experts to mediate in the political deadlock between the regional and national governments.\r\nColau earlier met with consular representatives of European countries and shared with them the need for a \"task force under the European umbrella\" to facilitate a dialogue, with the help of academics, jurists and regional lawmakers of all parties.\r\nOfficials in the European Union have called for dialogue, but have supported Spain's conservative government in blaming the political crisis on Catalonia's regional government.\r\nThe ruling Catalan coalition and other separatist politicians have declared valid the results of a referendum on 1 October that was held amid police violence and against a Constitutional Court suspension.\r\nEU officials have also said that Catalan government's bid for independence is an internal Spanish affair.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/2d290960c3d53dc353a976d044e6871b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
