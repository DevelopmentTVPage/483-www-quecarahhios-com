    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) Neymar insisted that money was not a motivation in deciding to join Paris Saint-Germain and said Friday that he would not be burdened by his 222 million-euro (262 million US dollars) price tag.\r\nThe Brazilian star flew in from Barcelona on a private jet for his official presentation, arriving in a city whose soccer fortunes he is expected to transform.\r\nAt a packed Paris news conference, Neymar found it \"really sad\" to be asked whether the riches on offer were the reason for his decision to swap one of soccer's most illustrious teams - Barcelona has won every major honor multiple times - for a club yet to win the biggest competitions outside of France.\r\nThe move more than doubled the previous transfer record.\r\n\"The fact I am the most expensive player is not a burden. I am 69 kilograms (152 pounds),\" Neymar said through a translator.\r\nA record-breaking transfer leaves PSG having to squeeze every euro out of the signing - through sponsorship, merchandise and jersey sales - to ensure the club complies with European soccer's financial regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a5f71f220a789f12d7de0c60048edde0 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
