    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is taking new steps to use technology to improve access to health care for veterans across the country, including in rural areas.\r\nPresident Donald Trump announced the initiatives Thursday at the White House. \r\nVeterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin said the initiatives include using video technology and diagnostic tools to conduct medical exams. \r\nVeterans will also be able to use mobile devices to schedule, reschedule or cancel appointments with a VA doctor.\r\nThe new programs are in addition to existing \"telehealth\" programs that Shulkin says provided care to more than 700,000 veterans last year.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/2b8b04b49542e15f22ce1b3960c346bb \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
