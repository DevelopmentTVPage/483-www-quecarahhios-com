    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) US  President Donald Trump's feud with the US National Football League (NFL) over players who kneel in protest showed no signs of abating on Tuesday as he called for the NFL to ban the practice.\r\nOn Monday NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart defended players' rights to peacefully protest what they view as racial inequality and police mistreatment of black males.\r\nBut on Tuesday Trump tweeted: \"The NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations. The only way out for them is to set a rule that you can't kneel during our national anthem!\"\r\nIn an earlier tweet, Trump claimed the \"issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race.\"\r\nPublic opinion in the US is mixed on whether professional athletes should be required to stand for the national anthem as Trump would like, and there is a racial split in how Americans process the issue.\r\nMore than half of Americans, or 52 per cent, said in a September 2016 Marist Poll that sports leagues should require their players to stand for the national anthem. \r\nWhile a majority of whites, 56 per cent, said standing should be required, most Latino adults, 55 per cent, and nearly half of African-Americans, 48 per cent, said athletes should not be made to stand.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5b901b80316204c4f67e02c615074ac4 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
