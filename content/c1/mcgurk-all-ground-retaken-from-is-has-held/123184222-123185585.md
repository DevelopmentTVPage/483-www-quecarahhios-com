    "description": "(22 Sep 2017) The US special envoy to the coalition against the Islamic State group said on Friday that \"about 80,000\" square kilometres of territory retaken from the extremists \"has held.\"\r\nBrett H. McGurk, the Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, said \"about six million people - four million Iraqis, 2.2 million Syrians who used to be living under ISIS - are no longer living under ISIS.\"\r\nHe also said a controversial referendum on Kurdish independence planned for Monday \"carries an awful lot of risk.\" \r\nThe President of Iraq's Kurdish region said the referendum will go forward Monday, despite increasingly urgent calls from the international community to delay the vote.\r\nIn a statement released Thursday, the United Nations called for \"structured dialogue and compromise supported by the international community\" between the Kurdish region and Baghdad.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1b39328367b44acb1383d9a412484f6e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
