    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) Polls have closed across Iraq's Kurdish region and in disputed territories where residents cast ballots in a referendum on support for independence, according to local television broadcasts.\r\nThe vote is not binding and is not expected to result in independence any time soon, but was hailed as historic by Kurdish leaders spearheading the campaign.\r\nInitial official results are expected on Tuesday.\r\nBoth Baghdad and Ankara have spoken out against the referendum.\r\nEarlier on Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened military intervention in Iraq in response to the vote, stressing that Kurdish independence was unacceptable to his country.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/adb008ceaab0276e1823561a0b5eba90 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
