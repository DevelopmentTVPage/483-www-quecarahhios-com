    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) A light plane made an emergency landing on a packed beach near Lisbon on Wednesday afternoon, killing a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who were sunbathing, authorities said. \r\nThe National Maritime Authority said the man and girl died on the beach. \r\nHundreds of sunbathers were on the popular beach at Caparica, 30 kilometres (20 miles) south of Lisbon, and witnesses said some sunbathers ran into the sea to avoid the plane.\r\nThe small aircraft, reportedly a Cessna, carrying two people appeared to be in difficulty and wobbled as it skimmed low over the sunbathers, scattering them and spreading panic on the beach, witnesses said.\r\nThe plane appeared to have a partly broken left wing, which hung lower than the right wing. \r\nOfficials said the accident occurred at 4:50 p.m (1550 GMT).\r\nThe two occupants of the plane were unhurt and were being questioned by police.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/b1a80f6593548c5aaf931e9b5f040779 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
