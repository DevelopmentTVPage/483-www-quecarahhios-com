    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) The Iraqi central government imposed ban on international flights servicing airports in Iraq's Kurdish region has gone into effect Friday evening at 6:00 p.m. local (1500GMT).\r\nProtesters gathered outside Irbil International Airport, releasing balloons which carried a message - \"Yes, for Kurdistan\".  \r\nThe flight ban has so far been the most significant escalation amid heightened tensions - largely marked by threats from Baghdad and neighbouring countries - following the controversial referendum on support for independence held by Iraq's Kurds Monday.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/743aefc6abbdf37615b2a1316a89fc63 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
