    "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Banana growers were giving away their produce to people in Buenos Aires on Wednesday as part of a demonstration over trading conditions.\r\nThe farmers organised the protest to demand government measures against the import of foreign bananas and policies to boost their sector.\r\nEven though one kilo of bananas can cost up to 30 pesos at a grocery store local producers said that they are paid between 1 and 1.20 peso per kilo.\r\nArgentine bananas are produced in the northern provinces of Salta, Jujuy and Formosa.\r\nAccording to the organisers, a total of thirty thousand kilos of bananas were given away during the \"bananazo\" action.\r\nThose who lined the Plaza de Mayo square to receive bananas voiced their support for the producers, complaining about the high prices of fruit caused by the country's inflation.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/49546ce91c8655129937748e7dd67ae3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
