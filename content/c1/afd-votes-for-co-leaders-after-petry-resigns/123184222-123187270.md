    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) The anti-migrant party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), gathered in Berlin on Tuesday for their first meeting after a strong showing at the polls. \r\nMembers voted for heads of the parliamentary group, statute and agenda.\r\nAlternative for Germany won 12.6 per cent of the vote in Sunday's election to win seats in the national parliament for the first time. \r\nFrauke Petry, its co-chairwoman since 2015, told reporters on Tuesday she would leave the party \"in the coming days.\" \r\nAfD are the first far-right party to enter the German parliament since World War II. \r\nThe party has been beset by infighting since its founding in April 2013. \r\nOriginally formed as an anti-euro party, the AfD had since shifted its focus to immigration and Islam.\r\nPetry has said she was aiming to make the AfD ready for government in 2021, and urged her party earlier this year to exclude members who expressed extremist views.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/e547ce3e1370bd7055e7ff9a4e5d9bc6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
