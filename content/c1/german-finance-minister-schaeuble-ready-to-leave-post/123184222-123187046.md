    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, a key figure during the eurozone's struggle to survive its debt crisis and an often-resented advocate of spending cuts in troubled member countries, appears ready to leave his post.\r\nA successor might be less tight-fisted with spending at home but there's no indication the next German finance chief will be any more lenient when it comes to dealing with eurozone partners.\r\nLeaders of Schaeuble's party, Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, said on Wednesday that they plan to nominate the 75-year-old for speaker of Germany's lower house of parliament in the wake of Sunday's national elections.\r\nAs finance minister, Schaeuble ran budget surpluses and pushed for tough spending cuts in bailed-out countries like Greece. \r\nHe was a key advocate of the eurozone crisis strategy of giving bailout loans only in return for deep budget cuts and commitments to reduce bureaucracy and red tape. \r\nThe eurozone held together, but the austerity approach helped deepen recessions by withdrawing the stimulus of government spending from economies.\r\nUnder Schaeuble, Germany has also opposed reducing the principal amount of Greece's bailout loans, although it has supported other steps to ease the country's burden, such as repayment over longer periods and lower interest rates.\r\nHe was frequently lambasted by Greek politicians, on protest banners, and in newspaper cartoons. \r\nA pro-government daily portrayed him wearing a Nazi uniform.\r\nHis policies, however, found widespread resonance among legislators, economists and news media back in Germany. \r\nOn the domestic front, he opposed new borrowing to fund investment in infrastructure despite criticism largely from outside Germany that such fiscal restraint was holding back the recovery of the currency union as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ff8bcaf79a4cd1bb0594fa745484d084 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
