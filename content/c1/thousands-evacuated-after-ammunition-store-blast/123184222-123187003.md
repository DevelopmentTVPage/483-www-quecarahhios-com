    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) A huge fire at an ammunition depot in central Ukraine has set off a series of explosions and prompted an evacuation of thousands of people, officials said on Wednesday.\r\nAuthorities evacuated 30,000 people from the town of Kalynivka, 190 kilometres (120 miles) southwest of the capital, Kiev, and turned off the electricity and gas supply after the depot at a military base there caught fire late on Tuesday.\r\nThe powerful explosions created massive fireballs that lit up the night sky. Smoke was seen billowing on Wednesday morning. \r\nFour residential buildings were damaged by fire but no casualties at yet have been reported.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/7dc523c0635b536c36c12e49314b32fc \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
