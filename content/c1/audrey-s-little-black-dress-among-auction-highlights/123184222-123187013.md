    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) Bidders from around the world had Audrey Hepburn in their sights on Wednesday as the Hollywood actress' collection of clothes and personal effects were auctioned at Christie's in London. \r\nHepburn, who died in 1993, was a film icon whose best-known movies included \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\" \"Charade\" and \"My Fair Lady.\" \r\nBut she was also a towering figure in the fashion world, credited with popularising the concept of the \"little black dress\".\r\nSome of the items on sale went for more than ten times their estimated price. \r\nHepburn's little black dress from \"Charade\" went for 92,000 US dollars, including the buyer's premium, compared with a pre-sale estimate of 64,000-100,000 US dollars.\r\nHer working script for \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" went for 847,000 US dollars, including the buyer's premium, compared with a pre-sale estimate of 70,000-110,000 US dollars.\r\nAnd her Burberry trench coat, regarded as one of her signature fashion statements, was sold for 92,000 US dollars, almost ten times its pre-sale estimate.\r\nEven a humble sleep mask worn by Hepburn, which had been expected to sell for less than 200 US dollars, made more than 8,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/03cccfe243cd3e64e08bc3e74f2967fb \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
