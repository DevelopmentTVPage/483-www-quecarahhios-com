    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Catalan farmers drove their tractors along a street in the centre of Barcelona on Friday in favour of Catalan citizens' right to vote in a referendum on independence.\r\nIt came as Spain's government cabinet spokesman says there will not be a referendum on Catalonia's independence on Sunday as announced by the regional Catalan government.\r\nCulture Minister Inigo Mendez de Vigo accuses the secessionist coalition ruling the northeastern region of bending the laws to go ahead with a vote regardless of warnings from courts and a suspension by the country's Constitutional Court earlier this month.\r\n\"This is a demonstration so that the world understands with more strength that on the 1st of October we will vote and we will vote freely,\" said 53-year-old farmer Giner Pinyols.\r\nCatalan authorities say they will declare independence within 48 hours after announcing the vote's results if the yes wins. \r\nThe Spanish government has fought the referendum with a myriad of legal actions that have been criticised by many in Catalonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/0dfbd17ebc51fc3c55db59e536431bf8 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
