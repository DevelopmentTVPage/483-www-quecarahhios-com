    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Pro-independence farmers riding tractors rode down Barcelona streets on Friday ahead of a disputed referendum on independence from Spain, shouting \"We will vote\". \r\nPeople lined the streets as they drove past and applauded them.\r\nAuthorities in Catalonia intend to ensure that the referendum will take place peacefully on Sunday despite a crackdown on the vote by the national government, the region's interior chief said Thursday.\r\nMinister Joaquin Forn said that Catalan officials are determined to proceed with Sunday's vote for the region of 7.5 million people in northeastern Spain even though the central government in Madrid says the referendum is illegal and can't happen.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5c34ca21a4c5ff04b874d1ba8ce80a19 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
