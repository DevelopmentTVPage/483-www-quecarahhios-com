    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) A large crowd of people lined up in Buenos Aires' central Plaza de Mayo square on Tuesday at the open air market that was set up to call attention to the plight of small scale farmers whose profit margins are shrinking.\r\nMany of those in the square came to fill grocery bags with fresh produce being sold by the farmers who were selling fruit and vegetables at cost price.\r\nThe colourful demonstration was organized by various groups to draw attention to the low profit margins for producers compared with the high prices of the products in supermarkets throughout Argentina.\r\nThe protesters are calling on the government to implement import restrictions on key products and put in place a policy of low interest loans enabling them to buy or retain land that they are currently renting at \"above the odds\" prices.of all and any content included within the AP Television News service and for libel, privacy, compliance and third party rights applicable to their Territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/89d3b21354970c9f7f122fe4f9ff2768 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
