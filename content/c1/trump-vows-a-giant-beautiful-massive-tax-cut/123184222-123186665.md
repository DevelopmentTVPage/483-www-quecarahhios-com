    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) U.S. President Donald Trump is promoting his plan for a sweeping rewrite of the tax code to an audience eager for the proposed change.\r\nTrump addressed the National Association of Manufacturers on Friday in Washington, saying he's working hard to help companies thrive, compete and grow.\r\nKey to that, he says, is a \"giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country tax cut.\"\r\nThe president and congressional Republicans this week released the outlines of a nearly 6 (t) trillion US dollars  tax cut plan.\r\nThe plan would deeply reduce taxes for corporations, and simplify tax brackets and nearly double the standard deduction used by most tax filers. Many details remain to be fleshed out, however.\r\nTrump says he's working to level the playing field for American workers to they can better compete with workers around the world.\r\nTrump wants to sign tax legislation into law by the end of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/063840f815697e0e3891c348b0c3b0bc \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
