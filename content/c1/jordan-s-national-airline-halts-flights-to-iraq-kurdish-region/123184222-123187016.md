    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) Jordan's national airline says it is halting flights to Iraq's Kurdish region, as of 1800 local time on Friday until further notice. \r\nRoyal Jordanian said on Wednesday that it made the decision at the request of the Iraqi authorities. \r\nThe airline says Iraq asked all airlines to stop all flights to Irbil and Suleimaniyeh in northern Iraq's Kurdish region. \r\nThe Kurdish region voted for independence this week in a non-binding referendum rejected by the Baghdad government and Iraq's neighbours. \r\nRoyal Jordanian operates 10 weekly flights to Irbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, and three weekly flights to Suleimaniyeh, also in the Kurdish region.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/7d8218d8d4fbc162ced1a45c49256847 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
