    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) Russia has donated a statue of Peter the Great to the French Academy of Sciences to mark 300 years since the Russian czar visited Paris in a pivotal moment in his crusade to open his country toward the West.\r\nIn unveiling the bust Thursday, Russian Deputy Culture Minister Alla Manilova told The Associated Press it's a \"gesture that underlines the depths of our relations.\"\r\nShe also called it a gesture of \"historic justice\": While the French academy holds busts of other great world thinkers, she said, \"there was one who wasn't here \u2014 it was Peter.\"\r\nThe ceremony in the prestigious, domed Paris academy comes as French President Emmanuel Macron has cautiously sought to improve ties with Russia after years of East-West tensions over Moscow's actions in Syria and Ukraine.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4f3c36e5d7a5f7f86a7ab29aaad0d3ea \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
