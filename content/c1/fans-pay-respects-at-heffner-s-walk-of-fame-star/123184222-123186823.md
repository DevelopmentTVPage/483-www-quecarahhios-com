    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Flowers were placed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame star of publisher Hugh Hefner Thursday at the 7000 block of Hollywood Boulevard. \r\nHefner was honoured with his star on April 10,1980. \r\nHefner died Wednesday at age 91 at his home, the Playboy Mansion, in Los Angeles, according to a post on Playboy's official Twitter feed.\r\nPlayboy announced no immediate funeral plans, but Hefner owned a plot in a Los Angeles cemetery next to Marilyn Monroe.\r\nPictures of a nude Monroe catapulted Playboy to success with its first edition in 1953.\r\nHis Walk of Fame star is for television, which he used to promote the publication as host of a cable-television program called \"Playboy's Penthouse,\" in his nightclubs and at jazz festivals.\r\nThe magazine was the cornerstone of a multimedia empire that made Hefner a multi-millionaire, though the magazine's popularity slipped in recent years. \r\nHoping to attract more advertising, in 2015, Playboy ceased publishing images of naked women, citing the proliferation of nudity on the internet but restored its traditional nudity earlier this year.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4a58831439195032dc2d2cb6e8d6a53a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
