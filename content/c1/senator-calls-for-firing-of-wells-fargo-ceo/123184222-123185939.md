    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren told Wells Fargo CEO Tim Cook he should be fired and that the Federal Reserve should remove all company board members who served during the fake bank account scandal. \r\nThe Democrat made the remarks during a congressional hearing on the scandal on Tuesday. \r\nWells Fargo has said that 3.5 million accounts were potentially opened without customers' permission between 2009 and 2016, as employees tried to meet ambitious sales targets. \r\nSloan's predecessor, John Stumpf, testified twice in front of Congress last fall and the scandal cost him his job.\r\nCook says the bank remains \"deeply sorry\" for its previous sales practices, and that in the year since the scandal over them exploded it has substantially changed for the better.\r\nHowever, some U.S. Senators questioning Wells Fargo's CEO say an auto insurance scandal at the bank earlier this year show the bank's culture hasn't changed.\r\nWells Fargo acknowledged earlier this year that it signed up tens of thousands of auto loan customers up for insurance they did not need, and some of those customers who could not afford the auto insurance had their cars repossessed.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1b8d5ee8d609484b8245bb9bed90e609 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
