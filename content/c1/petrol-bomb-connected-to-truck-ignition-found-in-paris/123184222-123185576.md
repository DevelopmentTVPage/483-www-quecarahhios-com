    "description": "(5 Oct 2017) Paris authorities are investigating gasoline canisters and an apparent detonator found under cement trucks belonging to a company under investigation for allegedly striking deals with Islamic State extremists.\r\nA police official said six containers of gasoline and an apparent crude detonation device were found under trucks at a LafargeHolcim cement site in northeast Paris on Thursday.\r\nThe official said no one has been arrested, nothing exploded and no one was hurt.\r\nThe Paris prosecutor's office has opened a criminal investigation into an alleged attempt to set a destructive fire, according to a judicial official.\r\nThe motive for the attempt is unclear, but the case has not been handed to counterterrorism authorities.\r\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.\r\nSwiss-French LafargeHolcim, the world's largest cement maker, would not comment on the incident.\r\nThe company is suspected of paying IS extremists to ensure safe passage for its employees and material at its cement plant there in 2013 and 2014, despite international sanctions.\r\nThe company, which has acknowledged striking deals with armed groups in Syria, later stopped its Syria operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/89fc69016045ccc50aeaffee176a67f1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
