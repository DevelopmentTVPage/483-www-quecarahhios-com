    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) Democratic Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania said Monday the Graham Cassidy bill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act is a \"venomous snake\" that would \"cause great harm to people.\" \r\nCasey made the comments at a Washington, DC news conference where he was joined by a number of patients with pre-existing conditions, who urged Senators to vote down the measure.\r\nThe bill would repeal the financing for Obama's health insurance expansion and create a big pot of money states could tap to set up their own programs, with less federal oversight. \r\nIt would also loosen through state waivers current insurance rules that protect people with pre-existing conditions and limit spending for Medicaid, the federal-state program that now covers more than 70 million low-income people.  \r\nAshley Murosky who suffers from lung cancer told the news conference she is \"consumed with the fear of what could happen\" to her if the Graham Cassidy bill becomes law.\r\nShe fears she won't be able to pay for her treatments or daily chemotherapy drug.\r\nJodi Smith Lemacks, whose 14-year-old son Josh, who was born with congenital heart disease ,said the legislation will be putting her son's life - and the life of so many other children - at grave risk.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cef63967152cac294893ec9ed47fc287 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
