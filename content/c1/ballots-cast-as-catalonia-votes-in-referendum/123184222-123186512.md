    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) Hundreds of Catalans did manage to cast their ballot in the disputed independence referendum on Sunday, despite Spanish police trying to halt the plesbicite by smashing their way into some polling stations and firing rubber bullets at protesters outside one polling station.\r\nTension had been on the rise since the vote was called in early September, crystalising years of defiance by separatists in the affluent region, which contributes mightily to Spain's economy. \r\nAs one of Spain's 17 autonomous regions, Catalonia enjoys ample rights, but key areas such as infrastructure and taxes are in the hands of Madrid. \r\nSeparatist Catalans have long complained of contributing too much to the state while not getting enough in return.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8a5a71d35c1854b8ca5a7c3352da01f4 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
