    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) Sen. Luther Strange and firebrand jurist Roy Moore faced off Tuesday in the Alabama Republican primary runoff in a race that has pitted President Donald Trump against his former strategist, Steve Bannon. \r\nThe winner of the runoff will become the favorite in December's election against Democrat Doug Jones to fill the remainder of Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Senate term.\r\nTrailing in the polls, Strange has looked to the White House to help make up ground against Moore, the former Alabama chief justice who is best known for defiant stands against gay marriage and for the public display of the Ten Commandments. \r\nVice President Mike Pence campaigned for Strange in Birmingham, Alabama, while Bannon, speaking at a Moore rally, argued Moore is a better fit for Trump's \"populist\" movement.\r\nStrange supporter Hayden Lee, who works in insurance sales, said she didn't have an opinion of Moore but voted for the incumbent solely because Trump endorsed him.\r\n\"I'm just trying to make everything work,\" Lee said after voting in Pelham. \"I think you've got to get along with the president to make it work.\"\r\nMerlene Bohannon, a widow with three grown children, said she had planned to vote for Strange until seeing Bannon stump for Moore on Fox News on Monday night.\r\n\"Steve Bannon and God spoke to me, and this morning when I went in I voted for Moore,\" said Bohannon, 74.\r\nA super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has pumped millions of dollars into the Alabama race on behalf of Strange. \r\nBannon has argued Alabama can show the world that his populist, nationalist, conservative movement is on the rise.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/784e81dd506f3ea244e5a8c24a5af5b9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
