    "description": "(1 Aug 2017) The son of the former Caracas Mayor who was taken from his from his home in the early hours of Tuesday and thrown in jail, said their family will continue fighting. \r\nDuring an interview in the headquarters of the political party Alianza Bravo Pueblo, Victor Ledezma said they would continue to \"wage the battle without fear\" for democracy for Venezuela.\r\nAntonio Ledezma and opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez were forcibly taken from their homes by Venezuela's intelligence service SEBIN and are being held in the military prison Ramo Verde. \r\nThe justice department claims both men broke the term of their house arrest.\r\nLopez was detained three years after protests against President Nicolas Maduro's government and sentenced to more than a decade in prison on charges that include inciting protesters to violence. \r\nHe was released last month to serve the rest of his term under house arrest. \r\nLedezma was also detained in 2015 and has been under house arrest.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c5a5506cfc39da4dccd0028bd82fcddc \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
