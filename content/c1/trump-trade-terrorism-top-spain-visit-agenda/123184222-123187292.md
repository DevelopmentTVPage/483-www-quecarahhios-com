Spain's federal government says such a vote would be illegal.\r\nNeither leader mentioned the vote during brief remarks as they appeared before journalists in the Oval Office and Cabinet Room, where they held a working lunch.\r\nRajoy says the two countries have good cooperation on defense and terrorism issues.\r\nTrump said Spain and the U.S. have had \"tremendous success... in terms of what we have done to get rid of this threat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8297daa582176fa9ad60e24e13d2a2ac \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
