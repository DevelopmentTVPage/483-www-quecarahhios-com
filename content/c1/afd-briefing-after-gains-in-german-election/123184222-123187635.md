    "description": "(25 Sep 2017) A top candidate of the German nationalist party Alternative for Germany, or AfD, said that Germany's migration policy was \"lacking every legal basis\".\r\nSpeaking at a news conference on Monday, Alice Weidel also criticised a potential coalition between CDU\/CSU, the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) - called a \"Jamaica\" coalition because the parties' colours match those of the Caribbean nation's flag - as a means to \"prevent us from being the leading opposition force.\".\r\nThe centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) - German chancellor Angela Merkel's partners since 2013 in a \"grand coalition\" - are set to become the largest parliamentary opposition group after they vowed not to become a partner in another \"grand coalition\" following a heavy defeat. \r\nAt the joint news conference, AfD top candidate Alexander Gauland said the terminology of \"reclaiming\" the country was \"meant symbolically\" and signified that they did \"not want to lose Germany to an invasion of foreign people from foreign cultures\". \r\nMeanwhile AfD co-chairman Joerg Meuthen accused political opponents of sowing \"the seed of violence\" by likening their views to those of Nazis, insisting theirs was a \"deeply constitutional and free party\". \r\nAfD received 12.6 percent support in the election.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1e562039df517fe132bf9b77ee6f4178 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
