    "description": "(4 Aug 2017) Venezuelans playing professional baseball in the United States are expressing sadness over the political turmoil happening back home. \r\nVenezuela's ruling party on Friday installed a new super assembly that supporters promise will pacify the country and critics fear will be a tool for imposing dictatorship.\r\nThe assembly was scheduled to meet again Saturday, and Rodriguez pledged it would be taking action against Maduro's political opponents.\r\nThe installation of the all-powerful constitutional assembly is virtually certain to intensify a political crisis that has brought four months of protests that left at least 120 people dead and hundreds jailed. \r\nFrancisco Cervelli of the Pittsburgh Pirates was born in Valencia. The New York Yankees signed him as an international free agent in 2003.\r\nCervelli told AP that Venezuela is \"his mother,\" adding, \" Venezuela is everything. Venezuela is what I remember, the most beautiful country I ever see in my life.\"\r\nJose Martinez of the St. Louis Cardinals was born in La Guaria to former MLB player Carlos Martinez. The Baltimore Orioles signed the younger Martinez in 2006.\r\nMartinez says many of his family members remain in Venezuela.\r\nHe often sends them care packages because basic necessities are so hard to find.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/e0bddfe79b19cbe0f40ffebb2ddff72c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
