    "description": "(1 Oct 2017) Scuffles broke out as police tried to hold back people who had come to vote in a banned referendum on Catalonia's independence outside a polling station in the Ramon Llull school in Barcelona on Sunday. \r\nSpain's Constitutional Court ordered the vote to be suspended and central authorities say it's illegal. \r\nRegional separatist leaders have pledged to hold it anyway, promising to declare independence if the \"yes\" side wins, and have called on 5.3 million eligible voters to cast ballots.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c692c7e20ccb345ad2624a7c1b553ee2 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
