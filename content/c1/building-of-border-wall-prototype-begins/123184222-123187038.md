    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) The US federal government on Wednesday gave the media a first look at construction of prototypes for President Donald Trump's proposed border wall.\r\nCrews working on two of the eight prototypes moved dirt, with one of the crews also installing reinforcing steel bars before concrete is poured.\r\nEach crew gets only 60 square feet (18.2 square metres) to work on their prototype, prompting some to do assembly work elsewhere before moving the structure to their designated position.\r\nContractors have 30 days to finish.\r\nThe rectangular construction zone is fenced off from public viewing in a remote area of San Diego along the Mexico border.\r\nThe models will be tested for the ability to withstand sustained drilling with power tools and to deter border crossers with anti-climbing features. \r\nThey also must be aesthetically pleasing from the north side.\r\nThe government will consider the models to guide the proposed construction on the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200 kilometre) border with Mexico. \r\nTrump says he wants them to be see-through.\r\nFunding is a big question. \r\nThe administration has requested an initial 1.6 billion US dollars next year to replace 14 miles (22.5 kilometres) of fencing in San Diego and build 60 miles (96.5 kilometres) in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas - the busiest corridor for illegal crossings.\r\nDemocrats have balked at providing the money\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/79f85d960acf96c47cb808bb5ec3aced \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
