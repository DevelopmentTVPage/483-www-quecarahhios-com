    "description": "(29 Sep 2017) Police in Indian-Controlled Kashmir detained Shiite Muslim mourners on Friday after they defied security restrictions and participated in a Muharram procession.\r\nAuthorities in Srinagar, the region's main city, have banned large gatherings marking Muharram to prevent them from turning into anti-India protests.\r\nScuffles erupted when police tried to stop the marchers who were chanting religious slogans.\r\nPolice fired tear gas to disperse the procession and took away many of those detained.\r\nMuharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar, is especially important for Shiite Muslims, marking the death of Prophet Muhammad's grandson Imam Hussein in the battle of Karbala.\r\nThe processions and mourning peak on the 10th day, called Ashura, when Hussein was martyred.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1b45a047036f06156adecf54677c18a9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
