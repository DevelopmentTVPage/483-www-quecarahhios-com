    "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Brazil's embattled president survived a key congressional vote that could have suspended him over a bribery charge, mustering enough support on Wednesday night to stay in office and avoid being tried by the country's highest court.\r\nPresident Michel Temer needed the support of just one-third of the 513 members of the lower Chamber of Deputies, or 171 members. \r\nHours after the voting began, he had received the votes of more than that number of legislators. \r\nIn the end, 263 deputies voted for the president and 227 voted against him. The remaining were abstentions and absences.\r\nThe vote in the Chamber of Deputies began after a day of hearings and vote cajoling by both sides behind the scene. \r\nOpposition lawmakers tried unsuccessfully to delay the vote, an acknowledgement that they likely wouldn't get enough support to suspend Temer despite his dismal support nationwide. \r\nThe latest national poll said just 5 percent of Brazilians approval of Temer. \r\nThe bribery allegation, which stunned even Brazilians inured to graft cases, was the latest in a bevy of scandals that has rocked the administration and created deep uncertainty and angst in Latin America's largest nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/692eaefdb9c55f6d8e5b9b78f52147d1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
