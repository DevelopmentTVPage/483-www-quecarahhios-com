    "description": "(28 Sep 2017) As the death toll from Mexico's September 19 earthquake rose on Thursday to 344, with 205 of the deaths in the nation's capital, crews were still work at what used to be an office building in Colonia Roma Norte to recover the few remaining bodies there out of the rubble.\r\nWhile large slabs of concrete are removed from the rubble with the help of a crane, mason volunteers gather nearby and get ready to help clear the site. \r\nRoberto Campa Cifrian, the undersecretary for Human Rights of the Interior Ministry visited the site again on Thursday and told reporters every effort is being made to correctly and promptly identify the remains recovered from the building.\r\nMost of the capital's collapse sites have already been cleared of rubble.\r\nPresident Enrique Pena Nieto said Wednesday that preliminary accounting suggests that the recovery from damage from the magnitude 7.1 quake and an even more powerful one earlier in the month could cost upward of 38.1 billion pesos (2 billion US dollars).\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/421a1abd39e91609ca0124cf9bfb910e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
